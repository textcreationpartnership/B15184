            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

For hindring wherof he hath tryed all his possible meanes, as before we haue noted, but especially that of diuision, emulation, and contention hath byn his cheefest. For by emulation of the Nobility against the Cleargy, and of secular priests against reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, he raysed Iohn VVickliffe aboue 200. yeares past, whome Iohn of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster, sonne to K.

And by the same emulation it was diuers tymes proposed in Parlament, and otherwayes, vnder the Kings that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, Richard the 2. Henry the 4.

            <p>In the begyning also of this Q. dayes, the litle affection which the laity did beare vnto the Cleargy procured by some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet spirits, as also the smal vnion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Cleargy men amōgst themselues some holding with the heretikes and politikes by heat of faction, was a great occasion of the total ouerthrow of religiō whervpon
<pb facs="tcp:176260:17"/> also the same diuel brought in the diuision of opinions about going to the heretical Churches and seruice,<note place="margin">Religion hindred by faction.</note> which most part of Catholikes did follow for many yeares: And when the better and truer opinion was taught thē by preistes &amp; religious men from beyond the seas as more perfect and necessary; there wanted not many that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them selues: especially of the elder sort of priestes of Queene Maryes dayes.

For which cause diuers spies were sent ouer to nourish the said di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision as namely one Vaune (yf we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member wel) who died in the inquisition at Rome in the yeare 1581.

            <p>In the page 23. they make this general note in the margent: <hi>Iesuitae quae sua sunt, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> Iesuits seeke their owne, and not those things which are of Iesus Christ (for vnto that place of the Apostle they allude) but what shewe of truth hath this?<note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> or do these mē proue it in their text? no truly, no more then in the margent, and yow may see the place and shal find it so. Againe they note
<pb facs="tcp:176260:38"/> in the margent pag. 29. <hi>Iesuitici sedem Petri afficiunt ignominijs:</hi> Iesuitical men do disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and shame the seat of Peter; &amp; againe in the same page: <hi>Their propositions are impious against the Sea Apostolike.</hi> And may there be any probability thinke yow of this?</p>
            <p>Furthermore page 37. they say in the margent, <hi>that the persecution of Iesuits is more greiuous vnto them, then that of the aduersaryes,</hi> which perhaps may haue some secret true meaning, if the aduersary be he that setteth them on in this worke; and then pag. 45. <hi>Iesuits do trouble the peace of England,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation may come also perhaps from the same aduersary, who vseth it in all his wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and speches. And to the same effect they make another general note pag. 63. <hi>Iesuitae parum curant Ecclesiae tranquillitatem.</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits do litle care for the tranquillity of the Church, as who should say, that these men ioyning with the aduersary against their head and brethren, do care more for it, and more procure it.</p>
            <p>And finally not to spend more tyme in these trifles we wil end with one most odious note made against them, but indeed touching our selues and our countrey. The note is this, pag. 83. <hi>Inanis iactatio Iesuitarum de seminarijs à se erectis.</hi> The vaine bragging of Iesuits of Seminaryes erected by them.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176260:38"/> But where and when and by whome of them in perticular,<note place="margin">Very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</note> this vaine bragging hath byn vsed, they do not set downe in their booke, nor cannot, as we thinke: but sure we are that the general body vvhich they touch by this woord <hi>Iesuitarum</hi> cānot haue bragged therof, for that all are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our Seminaryes, and they are men that comonly are wont to do more in such affaire then willing to bragge, and truly vve cannot imagine, but that this is some deuised bragge, inuented and brought in by our angry brethren, to gaule them withall, but indeed to iniury vs and our countrey, who haue receaued the benefit of so many Seminaries by them and their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and haue need of their help and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance stil, for their holding vp and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning, which these men would soone ouerthrowe vpon splene and emulation, if it lay in their hands. And by this act of so extreme ingratitude, they do what they can to that effect, but God (we hope) vvil defend his worke begunne, and restrayne their power in pulling downe, which haue no will to set vp or conserue.</p>
            <p>And with this we might end, but that in this place our brethren do vse so fond a calumniation against the Iesuits and so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously false as no man can but wonder
<pb facs="tcp:176260:39"/> therat; for they say that the new Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes set vp by the Iesuits in Spayne and Flanders, are not so beneficial to England as may counteruayle the hurts done by thē to the two auncient Seminaries of <hi>Doway</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi>

            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:176260:40"/>

            <p>But these good fathers eares are now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to these vngrateful songes, and wil not be discouraged (we hope) therwith to perseuer and do vs good stil, seing they know now not only by Gods promises but by former practise also and experience that these blasts do blow ouer and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to the exercise &amp; trial of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and discredit of the doers.

            <p>And at the very same tyme some of our nation beyond the Sea being weary of their banishment and styrred vp (as it semeth) with the spirit of dissention and auersion against these men,<note place="margin">Diuers let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres vvryten this yeare into Engl. about this matter are yet extant and ready to be she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved vvhen need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</note> sought to make their peace with the Q. and Councel by offering seruice against them, wherof we haue seene sundry lettres wrytten in the yeare 1598. and in one of them no lesse then 15. articles suggested against Iesuits and how the Q. and councel might get them out of England by help of the King of France; to his Hol. which we might set downe in particular togeather with the letters and wryters therof, if we would follow the course of our discontented brethren and their consorts in this faction, but we meane to proceed more temperatly and spare their names for this tyme except we be forced in our longer Apologie to expound our selues further; only we say in this place, that it is an vnworthy and lamentable act for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike men to make their peace with the common enemy by offering to wound good men of their owne syde, &amp; religion, for gayning the others fauour.</p>

And not vnlike falleth it out in this our case, for that the late good Cardinal hauing enclyned as some men report in his later dayes, to contract a certayne affinity with a gentleman, carried away somwhat with this faction; though the Cardinals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention (no doubt) was (if the matter be true) to gaine him and his frends from that faction, yet by this shew and pretence,<note place="margin">M.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:45"/> can be imagined more absurd or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable to his memory.</p>
            <p>And first of all I would aske our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that do publishe this to the world, so greatly to his discredit, vvherby such Princes also as were his aduauncers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors may take suspition of his former actions, and thinke worse of him now, when he is dead, then they did while he was alyue, what reasons or firme argumēts can they shewe, for this their Asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Haue they any letters of his owne testifying this intentiō, or can they alleadge any one fact of his, vvherof this may be inferred? VVe haue cyted before his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest letters to the contrary wrytten not six moneths before he died to M. Mush (who seemeth the cheifest brocher of all these suspitious reports) as though the Cardinal had vttered great secrets vnto him at his being in Rome, vvhich is very vnlikely, the Cardinal knowing his busy nature &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to set strife,<note place="margin">The author of these false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Cardinal.</note> as may appeare also by the earnestnes of his said letter vnto him. Moreouer, we know that the Cardinal at this tyme, when the vnquiet by occasion of M.

            <p>And to beginne from some yeares past, vve haue seene the latyn original before mentioned of the said Cardinal gathered out of diuers letters of G.

            </p>
            <p>Thus much is vnder the Cardinals hand, and then in the same letters and confessions of G.

               <hi>and their expestation so great, as all England and Scotland must obay and serue them, &amp;c. Yt is more then tyme that my L. of Cassano or some other be aduaunced, for the comō good, and to counterpeise the Cardinal of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and his, to help to conserue vnity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

            </p>
            <p>And then againe making mention of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his faction (vvherof he seemed to accompt the L.

            </p>
            <p>And thus much about the agent in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy vvhere they thought to do much (that Duke being sonne in law to the King, and put in head by them to pretend the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Flaunders insteed of the Duke of Parma, as the most part of this letter doth treate, &amp; many ielousyes are cast in, to set suspition betweene those Princes, and with the King of Spayne, but all against Parma) but for Spayne they designed a Scottish man Bishop of <hi>Vessun</hi> in Fraunce, nephew

I wrote vnto your Lordship, it was wrytten vnto me that the said Prior was gone to my Lord of Cassano I haue borne and do bea e not a little for his sake, whome the Cardinal of England, and all his, do so much mislike and there is great diligence taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue him and his bretheren (the monkes) at difference, which is a maruelous vngodly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus wrote this man at that tyme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising and setting downe agents also for all other Courts to oppose themselues against the Card. as my Lord of Cassano his ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phew and others ioyned with him or depē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that way in Rome, the lo.

            </p>
            <p>And thus much of the designment, but of the execution, the Card. saw another letter wrytten the next moneth after by the forsaid Agent in Spayne,<note place="margin">The letter of Prior Arnold 13.

            <p>By all this and much more that might be said (for we omit of purpose many other letters, or rather reserue them for our other Apology) it may be seene that all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot for many yeres was against the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb facs="tcp:176260:49"/> principally, and against the Iesuits and their frends as accessary only so far forth as they vvere ioyned with him, and that is ment when they say, <hi>The Cardinal and his,</hi> meaning by <hi>his,</hi> the Iesuits, for so M.

It had byn a good turne both for my Lord Cardinal, &amp; vs of the better sort heere that he had neuer come hither, &amp;c.

               <hi>perhaps not so much to him &amp; his freindes contentment, &amp;c. By this trouble of M. Morg. I can assure yow that both of the best in England &amp; here be cold in affection towards your Society, the report being made in England by many Catholikes, that

            <p>Lo heere all faults layd on the Iesuits by them that accompted the Cardinal their cheefe enimy, as before hath byn shewed.

As for example in one of the 11. of December 1587. which vvas not many monethes after the Card. was made, he vvryteth thus: <hi>Haue pitty vpon my Lord of Dumblaine who I doubt is the more persecuted for
<pb facs="tcp:176260:50"/> my sake, yow know by whose meanes. Our Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of himselfe tould me, that notwithstanding the chyding of my nephewe, which yow know, yet his Grace and I shal euer be true frends, &amp;c.</hi> Here that he meaneth the Cardinal by vvhose meanes Dumblayne is said to be persecuted though without all cause (for that Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blayne did rather persecute the Card, as by many his actions and lettres doth appeare) is most manifest, for that no other can be imagined to be meant therby.</p>
            <p>And a litle after in the said lettre he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be commended by the Prior to <hi>Don Iohn Idiaquez</hi> the king of Spaynes Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary (as he calleth him) by the said Prior to some higher prefermēt he wryteth thus: <hi>If yow wryte to S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohn Idiaquez excuse me that I wryte neuer to his honour for modesties sake, least I should seeme importunate for my selfe, but when he doth me a good turne he shal haue letters from me and others inough to thanke him, and shal haue honour and ioy by me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Bish. of Cassan. his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note>
               <hi>And truly I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēber him daylie at masse; if he knew the meanes that are wrought to persecute me and blynd the world, he would loue me aboue all my nation, to the which truly I haue done more seruice then all others of them, be it spoken to the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the good man wrote complayning of his persecutions as yow see and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his owne merit before all others of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:176260:50"/> the nation, by which his discontentment and emulation is more discouered, then were to be wished, which seemeth to haue growne afterward rather then to haue byn diminished, for that the next moneth and yeare after, to wit the 2. of Ianuary 1588. he wryteth thus amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to the same man, hauing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his former letter to deale with <hi>Don Iohn de Idiaquez: what yow wryte to Spayne to the good Secretary, and my L. Duches of me, I know it shalbe louing and modest and if there were therin a few lynes pithie, and short and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual separately wryten as your owne attestation to be shewed to the king it were vvel that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary if he listed might read it to the king, Truly this ambition of the monopolie of all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synes of our nation is a very daungerous thing, and I knovv they cannot do yt, and are not so fit as they thinke, to do all alone.</hi> This said the good man. And by this we may see how daungerous a matter emulation is, and how by litle and litle it taketh roote &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, If the good Bishop had neuer said nor wryten more then this in appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing these mēnes dealing against the Card. from him, it had byn sufficient, not only to foster but to inflame their humours to go forward they being so vnquiet and restles spirits as may appeare, and desirous
<pb facs="tcp:176260:51"/> to swymme against the streame and hold a faction against the good Cardinal.</p>
            <p>VVherfore to go forward in declaration of our Cardinals knowing and discerning this faction to be against himselfe; and the common cause, there be extant two long letters of his vnder his owne hand to the forsaid gētlemā M. Th. Throgmort. wryttē the next yeare after to wit 1591. for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiō &amp; reuocatiō, if it would haue byn, from the said partiality; In which letters amōg many large discourses, he saith thus: <q>It is wel inough knowne,<note place="margin">Card. Allēs letters of the 4. Ian. and 30. of Feb. to M. Th. Throg. an. 1591.</note> that the things, vvhich haue byn done by that faction were neuer done against me for any particular or personal respect of myne owne, my selfe neyther before my promotion nor after, neuer geuing them any occasion in the vvorld of offence; But were rather done to the offence and special hurt of the commō cause, as to giue yow example, to draw from me my schollers vvhen I was in lesse degree then now I am, and to imploy them in publike seruices, yea such whome I knew to be discontented and disloyal to me, then their Master, as G. G. and diuers other priests, whome the world hath now discouered, all which were set a vvorke to their owne destruction, and ruine of the cause, &amp;c. And when it pleased God of his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176260:51"/> prouidence to induce the Pope and King to put me in this place, for Morg. and his faction to be so bold to addresse a special messenger the poore vnfortunate Prior of the Carthusians vnder pretence of other busynes of his order and house to deale openly with his Maiestie against me, and vnder pretence of my eyther insufficiency, or il dealinge in the comō affayres, to make supplication that another might be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the like dignity and opposed against me and my doings and followers, was not this a matter of comly quality,<note place="margin">Treason against the common cause.</note> or can yt otherwayes be accounted then a plaine treason against the common cause.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That againe some like discontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons after the death of the said prior, and Morgās imprisonment haue sought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade some about his Maiestie that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or fayned diuision of our banished countreymen rose vpon the difference of English and vvelsh Prouinces, &amp; that the remedy therof vvas to haue a Cardinal also of that part to ballance the matter as though it was alwayes necessary in Englād that theere shold be one English Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,<note place="margin">Good councel of the Card. to M. Tho. Throg.</note> and another vvelsh Cardinal or els none at all, &amp;c. And in the end he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vvith him thus: It shalbe euer good for yow (M. Throg) to follow in this kind
<pb facs="tcp:176260:52"/> the mayne streame, and the principal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes of your nation with so many of the best and greatest without comparison of the nobility, Cleargy, and religious, and not to cast your selfe into the creekes of a few, and very few discontented persons, who are not yet so many nor of such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, eyther at home, or with such Princes abroad as to counteruayle the number of those that mislike the dealings of these <hi>left handed men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Left han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men.</note> neyther yet inough to giue the name vnto a faction of a whole nation, as though the English vvere indifferently deuided among themselues, about these matters, vvhich is altogeather vntrue, and in a manner also impossible, though some of folly or fraud may geue it out &amp; others of simplicity beleeue it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus wrote the Cardinal to this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and at the same tyme he wrote also seuerally to M. Ch. Pag. a large letter, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding first F. Holt in very earnest &amp; honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tearmes as he wel deserued,<note place="margin">Card.

                  <hi>VVhere of</hi> (saith he) yow must needs giue me leaue to be the leader because so it hath pleased God, his Hol. and his Maiestie to accompt me; and not

VVherby it followeth that all those that seditiously conspire my disgrace, do bād themselues directly and traiterously against the good of their countrey and against the seruice of the highest Princes in christendome,<note place="margin">Directly &amp; trayterous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the good of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> by vvhome only we expect succour and releefe for our so vnfortuna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te state, and vvhen I name preists and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious yow must not straight wayes infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re (as yow seeme to do in your letter) that the priests band themselues against the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as though all the nobility in banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at home; were of Morg faction, or that preists vvere not diuers of them, of as good nobility as most of those few that be addicted to Morgan.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And as for seruants and followers in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland which yow say he shal fynd more by following another course rathet then this I do, God send vs come to the trial, and happily arriue there, and then shal you see by the effect, what lacke of frends I shal there haue, vvhere I thinke verily to haue yow my frend also, vvhich shalbe best for yow, and very grateful vnto me, howsoeuer vnaduisedly yow haue here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled your selfe in my aduersaryes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken matters.</q>

            <p>VVe do pretermit of purpose many other letters vvhich might be cyted, for that they would be ouerlong, as namely one vnder the Cardinals owne hand wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Gouernour of Flaunders 30. of Feb. 1592. about this faction by occasion of imprisonment of Th.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:176260:53"/> the first is superfluous, the second euil grounded, and the</hi> 3. <hi>as impertinent to be vsed vnto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus began M. Pag. answere and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting the same vvhich is more then two sheets of paper it may easily be seene, how matters vvent betweene the Cardinal him, and others, and vvhere the faction lay, as also we haue seene before by the Cardinals owne woords, and so much the more are these preists our brethren to be wondred, at and pitied that are fallen now vpon emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the reliques of this faction set vp and maintayned against priests &amp; the Card. their head &amp; of this man M.

            <p>But now to returne againe to our good Cardinal vvho seing himselfe beset &amp; bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on euery side by the said faction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned much therof, and namely to the Fathers of the Society who were his cheefest refuge for particular comfort in these tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and contradictions; but aboue all others the man whome our brethren seeke to disgrace now and vvould make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the Cardinal and he disagreed,

Allen,<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 4.</note> as before hath byn signified and that in part by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this gouernment it selfe, and that diuers principal heades or agents of this opposite part lyued in Rome, they did easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsee the difficultyes that would ensue, which was, that presently when any youth should be weary of wel doing, tempted with liberty or licence of lyf,<note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that the Iesuits haue had in this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes troublesome of nature or geuen to strife and sedition, he would runne to the aduerse part, and by them should be borne out, or secretly fauored and encouraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the discipline of the Colledge and obedience of his Superior, And therby would ensue great troubles and mischeefe.</p>
            <p>These inconueniences were easylie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, but not so easily remedied, especially the Rectors being strāgers for many yeares, that could not so wel looke into the true causes of disorders that ensued. And albeit
<pb facs="tcp:176260:63"/> they suspected them yet could they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue them. And as alwayes Sathan see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to cloke his attēpts with some shew of piety, so heere such as ment to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, and to styrre sedition, pretended diuers zealous causes of their discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: some, that the Colledg and hospital of our nation was in strangers hands: some, that many of the schollers entred into the Society, and were drawne therunto, as these men would imagine: some other, that the orders of the house were rather for children then for men, especially for graduates of English vniuersityes, vvhen they came ouer. All which pretenses being easily allowed by such as lay abroad in the towne, or from other places had correspō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by letters, and were content to heare of these difficultyes in the Fathers go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment troubles grew daylie; and it is pittiful to consider and shameful to our Nation, what molestations these good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers receyued by these meanes for diuers yeares togeather vntil the yeare 1585. that Pope Syxtus hearing therof, sent two Bishops to visite the Colledge, wherof the principal being <hi>Sega B.</hi> of <hi>Placence</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Cardinal;<note place="margin">The first visitatiō of the colle. 1585.</note> he found out the roote therof, as he testified in his second visitation 11. yeare after; but could not so wel put

To whome succeded F. Creswel for other two or three yeares. And albeit partly by these changes, and by the presence of D.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:64"/> not from tyme to tyme some troubles, and F.

But the second had more trouble, for that in his tyme the Card. dying, all the factions ioyned togeather, and put matters into a fyre, as before hath byn said.

            <p>Now then to runne breefly ouer some cheefe poynts of this scandalous tumultua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the beginning of the yeare 1595. wherof there is extant (besides the former visitation of Card. Sega contayning 40, chapters, and a multitude of particular

            <p>The good Cardinal being dead, great care was had presently for aduauncing the B. of Cassano into his place as no doubt it is thought that he should easily haue byn in tyme, if this ouermuch hasting of his frends had not hindred. But those that would needs haue aduaunced him prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously against the Cardinal while he was lyuing, as in the former chapter yow haue hard) had not patience to expect any tyme now when he was dead, but as though the matter had byn sure now and due and presently to followe, they caused first his nephew to buy all the dead Cardinals habit and apparel, as this narration she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth which being hard of in the citty and
<pb facs="tcp:176260:65"/> the tumultuation of these schollers follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing presently to the same effect did giue great suspition and mislike also to many.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The first petition that vvas made for the B.</note>First then it was agreed vpon among these pretenders, that wheras Cardinal Allen had authority to giue facultyes to all priests that should go into Englād (though he were not Protector) his authority should be demaunded in particular for the Bishop, as a man that knew better the particuler merits and abilityes of English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for geuing them facultyes then could the Protector Cardinal Caietan being a stranger, and it was so wrought that the Protector himselfe should be entreated to demaund this grace of his Hol. for the B. as he did most willingly and effectually (as he was a man of a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t noble and royal nature) but his Hol. foreseing by his great wisdome what might be pretēded hereby refused to giue the said faculties to the B. and gaue them to the said Protector, which made the actors of this designmēt to fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to suspition and diffidence with the said Protector.</p>
            <p>And here vpon hauing taken cōsulation a new (for now was M. Thomas Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton come to towne, and ioyning with D. Hugh Griffin the Bishops nepew and some others of this part, made the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176260:65"/> abroad and two or three priests of the Colledge ioyned with him drew many schollers after on the other side) their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond resolution was to make a very fayre Memorial to F. <hi>Claudius Aquauiua General</hi> of the Society that he would persuade <hi>Cardinal Caetan</hi> to obtayne this matter for the B. of the Pope praysing infinitely the Societyes good gouernmēt ouer them,<note place="margin">The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial for the B to F.

This memorial did Cardinal Sega afterward much wonder at, when he saw how many cōtrary Memorials to this they gaue vp against the Society in all the points that heere they so highly comēded. And the cause was, for that the General talking with the Cardinal &amp; finding that the Pope was resolute in this poynt, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Schollers at their repayre vnto him for answere to be quiet and attend to their studyes, and to desist from these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, vntil eyther his Hol. should of himselfe thinke what was conuenient to be done for aduauncing some man of our nation, or that the matter might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by other men of higher calling thē

VVherin being persuaded now that the Society is of a contrary mynd they haue conceaued indignation and auersion, as though the fathers were enemyes to them, their cause, and countrey, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is cunningly brought in before the Rector suspected it, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <q>Secondly some of the same faction heere abroad in Rome were put in hope to haue gotten the fingering of the Colledge rents vnder the name of a cōgregation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was made to the heads of offices and roomes to their contentment; and many priuiledges to the schollers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <q>Thirdly there is one here vehemently suspected for a false brother sent hither of purpose (out of England.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly I fynd such here, as I expelled out of Rhemes for their misdemeanour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly I find very many receyued at all aduentures. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly during these troublesome broyles, where
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176260:71"/> neyther study of learning nor exercise of vertue keepeth them occupied, no maruel if some yong men would willingly looke backe to the world, and take any occasion to go away with the rest. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenthly I fynd their heads ful of false bruits and differēces betwene Iesuits and priests in England, yea the selfe same faction that is at Bruxels to be heere also against the Spaniards, &amp; such as take that way. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly these are gone so farre and haue committed so many out rages, as they dispayre to go backe, and the multitude being sworne togeather maketh them more bold.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>These causes &amp; some other I fynd, &amp; haue shewed to his Hol. these dayes in more ample sort, then now I can wryte, besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his Hol. to haue pitty vpon the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; their madnesse,<note place="margin">D. Barets spech to his Hol. 1596.</note> who vndercolour of doing good to the Colledge and their countrey, do take the ready way to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw both, by putting vs in diuision not only with the fathers, but amongst our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues also. And for the Fathers I told his Hol. the many respects wherby we are most bound to the Society, and could not breake vvith them without wonderful shame and vndoing of Gods cause in our countrey. And concerning the secōd which is our nation, I declared to his Holines that
<pb facs="tcp:176260:72"/> against these few factious heads the whole colledge at Doway, the colledges in Spayne and S. Omers, the priests in England and generally all our nation Catholike (a few only excepted, by whose il councel these youthes were deceaued) stood vnited with the fathers, and with order and discipline against these factions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This was the effect of my speech to his Hol. who answered much to my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment willing me to attend to the remedies and to consult with the Cardinal prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and his Hol. would allow of that wee should conclude. So vpon thursday last the Cardinal F. General F. Tyrius the Rector and my selfe haue agreed vpon the remedyes, expecting his Hol. authority for the execution of the same. Thus it standeth, and within a few dayes we hope for an end.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus wrote that good man, but his hope had not effect for that tyme, through the exceeding obstinaty of the mutyned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but rather matters went worse and worse, in so much that F. General after diuers cōsultations, with his Assistēts resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to giue ouer the gouernment; but yet wrote once againe therof first to F.

Being comen to Rome we saw so much prudence, piety and zeale of our peace and common weale redound in his countenance and behauior (which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue was farre greater in his hart) that he was most welcome vnto vs: in so much

This done he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the schollers, and vpon the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension day made vs another sermon, and comunicated the schollers againe. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little after (for it were to long to put the whole letter) all the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are now remedied, by this most sweet and indifferent composition, I say a most true composition wherin we haue condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the one to the others reasons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all partiality or passion wherin I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but highly commend F.

            <p>This passed at that tyme, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all that Sommer following, and when in September they were to depart towards England I meane the cheef of those that had byn troublesome in the Colledge they went to take their leaue of his Hol. and one of them made, a very pithy (though breefe) speech to his Hol. about this matter, promising quietnes and all obedience for the tyme to come.<note place="margin">The Popes speech the 3. of Sept. 1597.</note> By which occasion the Pope geuing them first a vehement repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension for troubles past, exhorted &amp; cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them there with like instāce to be at peace, for the tyme to come both among themselues and namely with the fathers of the Society.<note place="margin">The letter of M.

            <p>Thus the matter passed then, and albeit afterward though new disorders commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some of the former troublesome left in Rome, some restraynt and punishment was layd vpō them, which F.

            <p>And when afterward D. Barret wrote wel and gaue frendly relation of some of their behauiours in Doway, that were sent away from Rome F. P. procured from his Holines and from the Protector dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for such of them as were not Priests to take holy orders and such as were priests to haue facultyes to be sent into England, as if these disorders had neuer fallen out, yea though some of them had begone to be troublesome againe. And this appeareth by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:176260:78"/> diuers letters both of Cardinal Caetan him selfe while he liued, and Cardinal Farne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius that succeeded him in the Protection of England, and of Cardinal Burghesius ioyned with them in commission for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our countrey, all which letters in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the said priests and schollers F.

And we know diuers our selues that haue receyued these benefits and good offices at his hands, and do presume they wil not deny it.</p>

            <p>INto noe one matter more vnwillingly do we enter, then into this of the Castle of VVisbich, which hath byn held hitherto by Catholikes in greate reuerence, as an house of Saynts, and sacred seruants of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God confessors and martyrs for these many yeares. Yet for that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy of mankynd spareth not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euery where, and the holier the house, the sooner is his hand, and foote therin (as for Monasteries &amp; Eremitages do testifie <hi>Cassianus Palladius,</hi> and other wryters, and for prisons of confessors and martyrs it is euident by <hi>S.

That when that Castle was in greate peace and rest, the Iesuits desyring to haue dominion ouer priests, procured, presently after the death of Cardinal Allen, and Card. Toled, that one F Edmond VVeston a Iesuite, being in prison should get voyces to be made Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior of all the rest which were to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 33. VVhich being done, by the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the maior part of the company, and certayne rules of orderly liuing for a shew being prescribed (albeit he for dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion refused it) yet at length by commād<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his superior, he tooke it vpō him, wherat others repyning there beganne a diuision and separation among them, wherof many disorders and incōueniences succeeded, which these our discontented brethren (if we may beleeue these libels to haue comen from them &amp; that they would
<pb facs="tcp:176260:80"/> euer wryte so manifest calumniations) do most odiously lay vpon the Fathers, and principally vpon the ambition of this F.

            <p>Hitherto are the words of the said rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this that followeth we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, taking the cheefe poynts only for auoyding prolixity. They say then that all the company in that tyme of peace, hauing no special superiors, referred themselues &amp; their affayres to the directiō of three men, who were F. Edmund, M. Metham, and M. Bluet, which last was in very good tune all the tyme that M. Metham lyued, for the great respect he bare vnto him, &amp; that he shewed euer a special dislike of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of M. Bagshaw, for the vnquiet spirit he saw to be in him, and continual quarrels he had with euery man being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed also of the great garboyles he had raysed vp as wel in two colledges of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, where he had liued,<note place="margin">Baliol. col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterhal.</note> as also in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Colledge, from whence he had byn expulsed by the Protector <hi>Card. Boncōpagno</hi> his owne hands. And that M. Metham had so great dislike of the mans restles, turbulēt nature, as he said he had a wyndmil in his head, and was once determyned to haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented and shamed him before the whole company, if F. Edmund by his intercession had not letted it, yet that others (and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely M. Stranguige) seing no remedy how
<pb facs="tcp:176260:87"/> to represse him by authority, procured against the opinion of many other, that he should be preferred to be one of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said cheefe dealers, therby eyther to gaine or quiet him. But he was deceaued, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he proued worse, and was so ful of braules with all men, as his ghostly Father being a quiet man was forced to giue him ouer. And at that tyme M. Bluet &amp; he were greatly out; he reporting euery where in corners most contumeliously of M. Bluets hasty rude and fiery nature, and M. Bluet protesting that he would <hi>trounse</hi> him (for so were his woords) and this falling out grew to such excesse one day in a good priests chamber, that had byn long sicke, &amp; liueth yet to testifie the same, that good F. Edmund was forced to fal vpō his knees, &amp; with much intreaty made thē frēds againe, but afterward M. Bluet lacking his old stay of M. Methams good counsel and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into many impatient words and deeds dayly by age and wearisomnesse of so long imprisonment,<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of frē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene M. Bag. and M. Bluet.</note> in so much as he would not only reuile and threaten men, but strike &amp; beat them also, as occasion was offered. M. Bagsh. tooke this occasion to gaine the old man by flattering him exceedingly &amp; excusing and defending his excesses, which good F. Edmund not being able to do in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:176260:87"/> conscience nor thinking it expedient for edificatiō of the house (though yet he bare also much) M. Bagsh. by these meanes grew in by litle and litle with M. Bluet, &amp; set him quite out with F. Edmund which was the very beginning and foundation of all our spiritual miseryes and dissentions, for so much as hence forward F. Edmunds godly exhortations were contemned by them and theirs, yea M. Bagsh. would not only deryde them, but go about also to picke out matter of heresy against them. And consequently, the more he preached order and discipline and the like, the worse some men were, thinking it a comendation not to follow Iesuites doctrine or obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs, which they went about by all meanes possible to bring in contempt.</p>
            <p>This then beeing the cōdition and state of that company it is easy to consider, what great disorders would presently ensue in life and conuersation, which yet is seene more particularly by a common letter of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort of priests, subscribed by eighteene hands, and wrytten in Ianuary in the yeare 1595. to F. VValley alias Garnet Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of the Iesuits in Englād, wherin they request his helpe and counsel (hauing no lawful Superiour at that tyme of their owne, to whome for that purpose they
<pb facs="tcp:176260:88"/> might make recourse) how they might best auoyd the greate inconueniences that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by this disorderly lyfe brought in by a few, and preuent the great scandal that was like to fal vpō the whole Catholike cause, by their publike discredit, yf spedy remedy were not taken, for that the heretikes eyes were bent vpon them, and would not lese their aduantage therin, if matters passed forward as they did.</p>
            <p>And for more perspicuityes sake, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all their disorders to ten principal members, disguising notwithstanding their speech by general tearmes, least it might fal into the enimyes hands; &amp; touching no man in particular. The first wherof was, in these woords:<note place="margin">Ten heads of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in VVi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbich brought in by seditiō.</note>
               <hi>Otium &amp; languor, atque à bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis studijs, &amp; virtutum exercitijs magna cessatio:</hi> Idlenes and lasynes, &amp; a great ceasing from good study and exercise of vertue. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was: <hi>Quotidianae rixae, iurgia, &amp;c.</hi> daylie brauling, chiding, cōtumelious slāders, &amp;c. The third: <hi>Pugnae &amp; vsque ad sanguinis effusio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, dimicati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:176260:88"/> and so passed they forward vnto ten heads of different disorders, or euident suspitions and perils therof, which for breuities sake we omit.</p>
            <p>Now then matters standing in this case, we aske euery good and indifferent man, desyrous to saue his soule and to be out of these broyles, what he should do in this case, if he had byn in it. For as for Superior there was none to make recourse vnto but heretikes, that would laughe at it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> worse part; and for priuate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitio▪ or exhortation they were not capable of it, but rather more incensed, and more resolute to be reuenged, eyther by way of the ialour, with whome they could do all, or by their owne hands. So as when M. VVigges an auncient master of art, and priest,<note place="margin">This is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the former vvryten re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation frō VVisbich this yeare 1601.</note> spoke but one word in misliking of certayne ouer hard speaches and dealings of M. Bluet, towards M. Ithel another priest, he was beaten twise by the said M. Bluets fist, as all can testifie that were then present: so saith the relation.</p>
            <p>The only way then which those good men could thinke of for auoyding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences a foresaid was to make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne rules of honest and ciuil conuersatiō among themselues with some head or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector for better obseruing therof which
<pb facs="tcp:176260:89"/> they desyred might be the forsaid F. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund; and so with all their voyces agreing togeather, they elected him, but he vtterly refusing the same, they made recourse vnto his Superior by a comon letter in latyn, subscribed with all their hands, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth thus:<note place="margin">The letter of 18. priests to F.

               <hi>Contulimus inter nos ab heri &amp; medius tertius (venerande Pater ac frater) de melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri disciplina, propter ea quae emerserunt apud nos intra septennium, vel mala, vel species mali, vel aperta scandala, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>This and much more they wryte in that letter alleadging many reasons of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and how that F.

            <p>Vnto this most earnest petitiō F. Garnet after some dayes deliberation and comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the matter to God yeilded, with those restraynts, which before haue byn specified that he should neither be, nor be called Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, or haue any place power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb facs="tcp:176260:90"/> aboue the rest, but only to direct them, not knowing or suspecting at that tyme (as after he protested by letters to D. Bagsh. himselfe, and to his General in Rome, to whome he wrote therof, and sent this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the priests) that any offence would be taken hereof or any such broyle made about it, as after ensued; but rather that by litle and litle all would be of this Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Academy and liue vnder rule, when they should see the sweetnes and decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, as in other places it fel out dayly.</p>
            <p>But on the other side this reformation being taken as iniurious to them, did by all meanes seeke to discredit and calumniate this holy and quiet purpose of their fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, especially the Doctor, who spared not his pen in dilating this argumēt to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For wryting to a certayne frend of his soone after the new orders were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted he sayth thus:<note place="margin">The cōtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious vvryting of D.

               <hi>Among vs there is made (as some call it) a separation, or (as others thinke and feare) a schisme, vnder pretence of making a new common wealth,</hi> cum meliori disciplina. <hi>The forme therof is popular, the worst of all other, wherin any one is as good as another, and commonly the worst (things passing by factiō of voyces) better then the best. A forme of any thing we can learne or heare without example in the habitable world,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:176260:90"/> except the</hi> Cynedrical <hi>cōgregations of</hi> Geneua, <hi>and the like. And therfore (belike) to make a shew of a Monarchie or mixt common welth of all the multitude, one is made an Agent with certaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine assistants, an vnvsual fornisecal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane name, smelling of nouelty, and farre vnfit for the contemplatiue quiet of imprisoned Catholikes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he beginneth his letter, and is very long, infarced euery where with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contumelious speeches and malitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the playne and simple mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his brethren priests, by which yow may discouer much his mynd and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And among other poynts he censureth F. Garnets restraint and limitation of F.

            </p>
            <p>Lo heere what difficultyes this man hath found in the obseruation of a few, breefe, playne and easy rules for praying, studying, going to litanyes, quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, peaceable meeting in thier refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, reading at the table conference of learning, going to bed and rysing with some order, &amp; other such like. VVho doth not see rhe mans nature and condition by seeking out those knottes in so smoth a rushe? But he goeth further then this, for as they wryte from wisbich that he was wont to bragge among them in tyme of peace, that when he would vex any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in Oxford, he drew their ordinary faults to felony, and afterward falling out with F. Edm, and others, he sought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to wrest their words to heresy.<note place="margin">Malitious maner of dealing in the Doct.</note> So here now remembring that clause of the heretical Statute and oath against spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual authority &amp; iurisdiction of the Pope, expressed in the words: <hi>Forrayne authority and external iurisdiction,</hi> he goeth about to draw therunto this Agency of F. Edm. for that he dependeth perhaps of a forrayne Superior, that is, of his General in Rome, as he doth also afterward draw to like daunger or calumniation of forraine Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:176260:91"/> the authority of the Archepriest comming from his Hol. and therfore he saith here immediatly after the former words: <hi>I wil suppose, we might safely admit such forraine authority, I wil not cast any daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or difficulty in sending or resending letters I wil not accuse any of our selues to haue Italiana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humors and idle heads, &amp;c.</hi> Do yow see heere that he would bring men within the compasse of the statute of <hi>Premunire</hi> or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for admitting a few rules made by themselues for more orderly conuersation? wherof I see no other reason or pretēce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be that which we haue now said; for that F. Edm. the director hath a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in Rome: who would beleeue that paission could carry men to such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes.</p>
            <p>But yet it is more wonderful to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his cauilling at the very lawes and rules themselues first in general and then in particular, wherby yow may see his humour who talketh so much of Italiana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humors he hauing byn also himselfe in Italy &amp; dismissed thēce as yow haue hard for his ouer troublesome English humors.</p>
            <p>Thus he wryteth of the rules in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.<note place="margin">D. B. His egredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations at the rules.</note>
               <hi>The lawes of this common welth to which euery free denizen at his infranchising must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, before witnes, do not only in themselues
<pb facs="tcp:176260:92"/> want the qualityes of good lawes, which ought to be honest, iust, possible, according to the nature and custome of the countrey, fit for the tyme, and place, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>And this in general which yet is spoken without all groūd for in the rules there is no mention of any such matter, but are most modestly and charitably wrytten, nor can he (comming to the particular) find any least ground, wherby to giue colour to these calumniations, as yow shal heare by his owne words: For thus it followeth in him immediatly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In particular</hi> (sayth he) <hi>after a preface of fayre general tearmes vsual to the very worst deuises that euer haue bin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And to the best also.</note>
               <hi>there is in the first and second lawes a stopping of reprehentions, contradictions and iudgments concerning this new platforme.

               <note place="margin">A very heynous offence for priests to sit at table as they come.</note>
               <hi>and by that title sit highest, should sit promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, a thing not practised in any orderly place in the world, a disgrace to all degrees of learning, And fit for Anabaptists, a seditious mutiny and confusion against the seueral orders of the church, a contempt of Reuerend age, and therfore to be left
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:176260:92"/> to the reuiued Arrians, whose saying that is,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra secta nō curat canos: <hi>a bayte to draw infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior men by hope of a shew of eminency now and then, which otherwise by their place and perhaps desert should comonly be obscure, and therfore a necessary cause of diuision against those which would not consent to such absurd inouations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus and much more he reueleth vpon this poynt. And consider we pray yow the mans, talent in picking quarrels, and setting debate, in that he can find so greate inconueniences absurdities and so heynous crimes in priests siting at table as they come, which is vsed in al modest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular congregations in the world, and all this styrre to make roome to his Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which God knoweth in what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world he gate it, and how worthily; but certaine it is, as farre as we are informed, by ordinary comendation of his superiours he had it not; And this being the greatest quarrel or inconuenience that he could finde in all these rules, to wit, <hi>that priests should sit promiscuously at table as they came,</hi> yet doubting least men would laugh at it, he seeketh an other quarrel, as though it were an vnworthie thinge for men of his dignity, and his fellowes to be limited to any rule at all though neuer so willingly taken vpon thēselues. To which
<pb facs="tcp:176260:93"/> effect he goeth forward with a supposal, saying.<note place="margin">A lofty cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor fraught vvith pride and vanity.</note>
               <hi>And were there no inconuenience in these lawes, yet the indignity of them, is much to be wayed, for what can be greater then to make priests sent with more then ordinary or episcopal authority to be tyed to the pleasure of such as be not their Superiors and to be prescribed by the orders of others, who should be better occupied in ordering themselues, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lo heere vanity, pride and emulation, which are the very grounds of all these styrres. His meaning is that these orders come from the Fathers of the Society who comonly do labour euery where to bring in good orders. But in this poynt there are extant diuers letters both of F.

            </p>
            <p>This and much more wryteth the said Father to M. Bagshaw, which for breuity wee passe ouer, &amp; many other letters, which wee might heere recyte, and wil come to speake breefly of the peace and compositiō made among them by two priests assisted with the letters of F.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:95"/> And that the better sort meant playnly and sincerely and from their very harts, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by a very spiritual letter of theirs wrytten to F.

            <p>M. Mush also wrote at the same tyme a very kynd letter to F. Garnet,<note place="margin">M. Mush. and M. Dudl. to F. G. 8. Nou. 1505.</note> in his owne and M.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:96"/> And no doubt the victory had not byn gotten, vnlesse yow on the mountayne had feruently lifted vp your hands to heauen, and assisted with the charitable fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp of deuout brethren and frends;<note place="margin">Consider hovv con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary this is to that they vvryte in these later libels.</note> your owne good desyres, and our endeauors, with most zealous prayer, and clamors to God, and his triumphant saints in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of their comon feast, good newes therfore yow receyue, the blessed fruite of your blessed desyres and paynes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These were his words at that tyme, which yf they be true, then are many other things very vntrue, which appeare vnder his name in these late libels, for that they are quite contrary to these. And wheras heere in this letter, he maketh a very earnest and spiritual exhortation to peace and vnion, shewing the great and damnable daungers, that ensue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, now he seemeth to haue forgotten that, by his later doings and wrytings, in these libels, tending expresly to manifest sedition. The note wherof, and of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy herin, must needs be greuous to al his frends. M. Bag. also contradicteth himselfe notoriously in this letter, for if it be true that he wryteth a litle before of F. Edmund that he behaued himselfe so wel in making of this peace; with what
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:176260:96"/> truth or modesty can he tel all the world now in print,<note place="margin">Lib. la. pa. 20.</note>
               <hi>that Father Edmund was so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do it that he sayd he would rather cast himselfe downe from the Castle wals, and that he was so astonished by the very treaty therof, as he was mute, and besides himselfe:</hi> and this calumniation being come to the eares of those of VVisbich, they do exclame vpon it, as a most iniurious and notarious ly, as by their late wrytten relation appeareth.</p>
            <p>The same relation also doth vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the false accusations, layd vpon M. Archer a venerable priest (whome since they haue caused to be put into the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tower of Londen) as though he should haue said that <hi>Lupanaria Roma approbantur, &amp;c.</hi> and other such fond and absurd propositions, which they haue fayned against him and set downe in their latyn booke which (as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) he neuer said, but this rather that at a certayne tyme hearing M. Norden say that toleration could not be without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, vsed this argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> to confute him <hi>ergo Lupanaria Romae appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur, quia tollerantur.</hi> VVhich instance, the other being not able to answere, tooke an occasion of large calumniation, set on and egged by M.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:97"/> the matter by explicating the priests mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, both doctors tooke also against him, as they would haue wryten whole bookes and treateses therof, had not God taken vp the controuersy, by cutting of M. Norden strangely; as before hath bin said.</p>
            <p>But now there remayneth only to say a word or two how this peace being once so solemnly made was broken againe. The cause I haue noted before for that they would be vnder no rule: and the present relation of VVisbich,<note place="margin">The true cause of the breach in VVisb. after the peace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> seteth it downe in these words: <hi>D. Norden</hi> (say they) <hi>hauing, bin mulcted oftentymes by force of the rules, for his fowle tonge, and lastly desiring to see the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Copye which was in the hands of the better part: when he had got them into his fingers (not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withstanding he had promised vpon his word to restore them faithfully) he ranne away with them to D.

               <note place="margin">The rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of R.

That when M. Bagsh. and his part, were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:176260:97"/> weary of the said new rules, they fayned an occasion of doubt whether M. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae Pound his name, were in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or noe, which being shewed, M. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den snatched the same,<note place="margin">Se the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of R. Fish. 12.

Mush and M. Dudley that they should burne or deface the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, &amp;c. And then these rules being cast aside, discord began to grow daylie more and more, and I both saw and hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, vnworthy of their calling. But those of the part of M. Bagshaw did seeme to beare themselues much more insolently, both in words &amp; deeds, then the other side.</p>
            <p>Thus he sayeth with a long narration of particularityes, which I omit, or rather remit vnto our other Apologie. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points are that he saw such disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behauiour in that side, which he fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and conuersed with all, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to doubt what to say or thinke of their cause. For he saw them so familiar and in credit with the Ialour and his wife, such banqueting, such scoffing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiue speech against the other side (with whome they would not suffer him to treat at all) as he was litle edified therby, and
<pb facs="tcp:176260:98"/> began greatly to doubt. And of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side he saith, that by their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and behauiour, they seemed much more humble, quiet, deuout, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified then the rest. And further he saith that once among other tymes, he walking in the court with some of both sides to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geather, he saw M. Norden speake twise or thrise in the eare of M. Christopher Southworth (a graue priest &amp; knights sōne) wherwith he seemed to be somwhat moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but had noe remedy, because no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man hard it; but afterward M. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den told both Fisher and others in the presence of D. Bagsh that he had called him knaue, and arrant knaue in his eare wherat they laughed merily. which is not discrepant from the complaynt of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other priest, wrytten from VVisbich the same yeare, who testifieth that the same Reuerend and worshipful priest was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led knaue,<note place="margin">M. I. G. the 14. Iuly. 1598.</note> &amp; Montebanck, by one of the said two Doctors in the presence of two priests come from abroad, for that he had giuen good and spiritual councel which was deryded. And the like liuery of knaue was giuen to an other priest by one of the Doctors followers, as an ordinary liuery vsed to be giuen by them.</p>
            <p>Thus reporteth Fisher in his answere
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176260:98"/> ministred to him in these words: <hi>Quid sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiret in conscientia &amp; coram Deo &amp; sub iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēto iam praestito de vtriusque partis hominibus &amp; rebus.</hi> VVhat he thought in conscience and before God and vnder his oath already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the men and affaires of both sides in VVisbich, and after confirmed all with these woords: <hi>Ego R. Fish. ita dico, iuro &amp; ratifico.</hi> And all this is confirmed againe by the subscription of his Hol. offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier. <hi>Ego Acharitius squarsionius, &amp;c.</hi> VVhich we do ad for more credit of the matter, &amp; for that we are to cyte diuers things out of this confession of Fisher in the chapters following. This last relation also of VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bich hath one thing touching the good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of those of the Doct. side, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be discerned their disposition, and this is: that when M Mush came to make the peace, he being led about saith the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to see the orders of this lesser nūber, was shewed 6. or 7. butteries for 13. persons they not suffering the 20. to haue any. And further the party that directed him, after he had shewed him all these, he brought him to a chimney where also there was good ale, and said here is an other buttery, nay said M. Mush there is the diuel, wherof that place was called afterwards me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <pb facs="tcp:176260:99"/>
            <p>By this then it is easy to see how and why began againe the new breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene men of different spirits and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions which breach hath continued vntil this day from worse to worse. And albeit now they are not aboue 5. or 6. at the most yet by their obstinacy, fauour of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, help and assistance of the Ialour, they do afflict and keep vnder all the rest which are not of their humors, and do seeme to be the heads and cheefe abetters of all this later sedition in England, and especially against the Archpriest, to whome as the other side of their fellowes did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently yeild obedience at the first comming of the Card. lettres,<note place="margin">The ready submission of the good in VVisbich to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Touching the detestable memorial heere mentioned drawne out and published against the Fathers of the Society,<note place="margin">About the memor. brought ouer by Fish. 1597.</note> at the very same tyme, when this association was in making, therby to discredit the said Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, against whome diuers good priests did suspect this Association in part to be deuised, it began thus: <hi>Breuis declaratio miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi status Catholicorum in Anglia.</hi> A breefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the miserable state of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in Englād. And thē he putteth downe 11. sorts of calamityes and miseryes which Catholikes suffer, all at the Iesuits hands. The last two wherof (by which yow may iudge the rest) are these: <hi>That Iesuits do hate &amp; contemne our vniuersity men of Oxford and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge:</hi> &amp; <hi>that Iesuits are more hurtful to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
<pb facs="tcp:176260:109"/> then heretikes themselues.</hi> And for that we haue seene the former Assertion vnder M. Bag. owne hand giuen to M.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:176260:109"/> liued in the Seminaryes with them most vertuously and with great edification, much esteemed and fauored by Iesuits, notwithstāding they were vniuersity mē, as M. Sherwyn, M.D. Haddocke, M. Rish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, M. D. Barret and others in tymes past. And for the present, there are very many both vniuersity men and graduats of both vniuersityes in all the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and are greatly made of by the Fathers, if their vertue answere to their degree. But if any man should be so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, as this man sheweth himselfe in his former wryting, accusing men of Arrianisme Donatisme and other heresyes, for that they giue them not alwayes the higher end of the table (especially among priests, and diuers that are his auncients) no maruayle if such graduats be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to Iesuits, that are men of otder.</p>
            <p>And this might be sufficient for this whole matter which now we haue in hād, but only thar we thinke good to ad a litle more about this memorial of Rob.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:110"/> as by his and others confessions appeareth; partly to be rid of him, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petially to rayse vp rumors in England, of whose proceedings and slaunderous ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les divulged there against the Iesuits, whē many letteres had bin wryten out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, at last he was sent backe againe in the yeare 1597. to Liege, at what tyme D.

            </p>
            <p>Thus much wrote D.

            <p>WHen his Hol▪ heard the former state of matters in England, Flaunders and other places, and of the murmuratiōs of some against the Fathers of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, set downe as wel in the foresaid contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious memorial,<note place="margin">See the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the northen priestes 24.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:115"/> and some one with aboue 100. hands at it, other with 40. and 50. all in fauour and commendation of the Fathers their labours and behauiour in England against the said slaunderous memorial, and many other in seueral letters of principal men which are yet extant, when also diuers of these did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preslie demaund some subordination, and gouernment, of seculer priests to take away this emulation of some fewe against the Fathers,<note place="margin">F.

            <p>This being determined to make a subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, we vnderstād that his Hol. tooke tyme to consulte for some monethes with the congregation of Cardinals of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, what māner of gouernmēt it should be for the tyme present, and by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it might be best instituted without any
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:176260:115"/> great innouation of matters in England, so as the state should not be exasperated ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by against the Catholikes, in which tyme also he willed informacion to be procured out of England of the fittest men for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as it was done, and diuers letters are extant of their opinion therin, though these vnquiet perhaps were not demanded in particuler, neyther was it needful they being so smal a parte of the English Cleargie.</p>
            <p>In Rome also, the opinions were asked by the Protector of the principal Inglish that resided there and could best informe, as namely F. Persons, that had often aduise from thence, F. Baldwyn lately come from England. M. Doctor Haddock, M. Martyn Aray, M. Iames Standish, and others that had labored in the English Vineyard, as also M. Thomas Allen, nephew to the late Card. and diuers els, who concurring with the opinion of letters comming out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as also with diuers other principal men that wrote therof from Spayne, Flaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and other places both of the necessitie of some subordination to be made and for the fitnes, and sufficiencie of M. Blak wels person, his Hol. resolued according to their opinions, and informations in these two poyntes, to wit, to appoynt a gouernment,
<pb facs="tcp:176260:116"/> &amp; that this man should be the gouernour, though for the third about the kynd or manner of gouernment,<note place="margin">VVhy his Hol. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed no Bishoppes.</note> he iudged not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the present to appoynt any other but an Archpriest (an ancient digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the church of Christ) least if he should haue begunne with Bishops he doubted very probably, that it would haue caused some great motion in England, for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wherof he resolued also for this first tyme not to write himselfe any Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal letters, but to commit rather the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the matter by special order to the Protector to be done in his name.</p>
            <p>Loe heere then the groundes of this his Hol. resolution so farre as we are informed by thē that were priuie thervnto, &amp; by this are ouerthrowne all those cauillations, &amp; suspicious coniectures which our discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented brethren in their late bookes haue set foorth about this meaning aswel of his Hol. and the Protector, as of those also that gaue informations, for procuring of this authority, sinistrously interpreting the one, and the other. For first we see heere that the necessitie of our diuisions, &amp; emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous proceedings one against an other did enforce, both Catholikes to desyre some subordination amongst priests, and his Hol. to yeild thervnto.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:176260:116"/>
            <p>For so long as our Cleargie proceded in the spirite of humilitie, obedience, peace, and vnitie, there was no need of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, for that euery one was a rule, and lawe to himselfe:<note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> but <hi>crescente numero discipulorum factum est murmur Graecorum aduersus Hebraeos, &amp;c.</hi> when the multitude of our priests en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and the former spirite in many of them decreased, there beganne presently murmuration, and emulation against the Fathtrs of the Society, as though they only did hinder vs, who indeed were and are the men that do principally helpe vs both in word and lyfe, and so long as we were content to learne: but some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the Seminaries (where they had byn vnder the Iesuits) with lesse or worse spirite then were to be wished,<note place="margin">Beginning of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō against Iesuites in England.</note> drewe others to emulate them, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had obeyed, for auoyding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it seemed in all good mens opinions (and the Iesuites aboue the rest) that the only or chief remedy would be to haue this subordination of <hi>secular Priests</hi> among themselues, wherby the other might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne foorth of all occasion of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thus much for his Hol. motiue to institute this Hierarchie or subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But for the manner of procuremēt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:176260:117"/> it was as before we haue said, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by F.

            <p>Behold heere F. Persons, and the Iesuites deliuered by the testimonie of our owne men from al the imputations, exaggeratiōs, and sinister interpretations throughout these whole late libels, layd against them,
<pb facs="tcp:176260:118"/> for their procuring the subordination seing heere it is freely confessed that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by Priests themselues with the consent and priuitie of the more parte of all the Cleargie,<note place="margin">See the letter of 6. ancient priests the 13 of Sept. 1597.</note> of which priests (the most ancient, and graue among all the rest) there are diuers letters yet extant demaunding this poynt.</p>
            <p>And moreouer we are most certaynly informed, that wheras euery where almost these libels do charge F. Persōs most bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that he would in no case haue a Bishop, or Bishops erected in England, the truth is quite cōtrarie, he being knowne to haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for many yeares, while Card. Allen was alyue that some Bishops might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, and sent Apostolically into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and for that one chief difficultie vvas about their maintenance, he procured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward being in Spaine, in the yeare 1591. that the good old Bishop of <hi>Iaen Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesco Sarmientos</hi> a great benefactor of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries &amp; <hi>Patrō</hi> of Englishmen was cōtent to offer the charges of mayntayning 2. or 3.

Bishops, An. 1592.</note> which he signifyed to the Cardinal in Rome.</p>
            <p>And at this very tyme when the matter was in deliberation in Rome about this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:176260:118"/> English Hierarchie to be appoynted vve vnderstand that F.

               </note> and gaue vp a writing to his Hol and to the Cardinals of the Inquisition to his effect, which is yet extant, and we haue seene the coppie cōteyning 9. reasons for graunting the same; the first wherof standeth in these woordes, <hi>Ad roborandos Catholicorum animos in ferendis persecutionibus, Episcopienim arietes gregis in persecutionibus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquis diccbantur.</hi> To strengthen the hartes of Catholiques in bearing persecutiō for that in tyme of ancient persecution Bishops were wont to be called the Ranimes of the flocke, &amp;c.

VVhich writing of his no doubt is yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the holy office to defend him from this calumniation that he and his can not abyde Bishops.</p>
            <p>And besydes all this we vnderstand that he procured Card. Caetan the Protector to go in person to all the Cardinals of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, and he with him, to make them capable of these reasons,<note place="margin">Hovv much F.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:119"/> testifie, wherby may be seene how this good Father is vsed, for his labours taken in our country affayres, and euery thing cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued in a false and contrarie sense by these maleuolous.</p>
            <p>VVel this then being resolued by his Hol. that he would haue an Archpriest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted in England whō all the rest should obey, he gaue commissiō to the said Card. protector,<note place="margin">The Card.

            <p>And finally after the whole institution set downe, and motyues therof, with the order, authoritie, faculties, helpes of Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stents, and other particularities, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with a most pious declaration of his Hol. and his owne desyre, wil, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>But not to stand vpon these matters it is a foule thing when for couering our owne wils of not obeying we seeke holes in the cotes, and authoritie of our Superiors, as these men do both against the Card.

            <p>Other reasons they alleage or insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate of their not obeying,<note place="margin">Coppies of disc. pag. 6. 14.</note>

            <p>VVel then all this being presupposed, and all heate of partialitie, and passion layd asyde we would aske our brethren in their consciences before God,<note place="margin">A serious question proposed to our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented brethren.</note> and as at the day of iudgement they wil, and must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere truly, and sincerlye, when they had seene, and read ouer Cardinal <hi>Caetans</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Patens,</hi> wherin vnder his hande, and publique seale he testified to them &amp; the whole world that in respect of the diuision and dissention raysed in England betweene Priests and Iesuites, or priests, and priests vpon that or other causes, and fot continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of discipline, vnion and concord.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthlie they say, that many of these priests refused to subscribe, as though they had byn a great multitude, or the maior parte which was most false, they not being the twētith parte at the beginning; of those that admitted the gouernment, and if they haue encreased their number since, it hath byn by as false informatiō as this was to the Doctors of Paris, and by perswading them to the participation of their libertie and freedome from all gouernment, which is a sore baite for yong men as all the world knoweth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly they say <hi>that they refused only to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the authoritie of the Archpriest before he had obteyned letters from the sea Apostolike for his confirmation,</hi> as who would say, that this being done they meant to be quiet, and as though in the meane space they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued themselues obedientlie, and moued no troubles, no man being there present of the <hi>Superiors</hi> syde to enforme the good Doctors of the contrarie, &amp; of these mens

            <p>Further no man was present in <hi>Paris</hi> to tel the Doctors how false that clause of information was, that it might seeme by the cardinals letters, <hi>that the Archprists autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was graunted by faelse informatiō, or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie was vsed in choise of him &amp; his assistāts,</hi> and that their messengers to <hi>Rome</hi> were not sent (as they pretēd to be enformed only of the truth of his Hol. wil (wherof in reason, and moral probability they could not doubt seing the Cardinal <hi>Protectors</hi> letters Patents for the same) but rather to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and make a broyle in <hi>Rome</hi> as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored after their arryual theare.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:176260:134"/> all other matters, the euent doth shewe how truly it was meant, for that after the said messengers had byn at <hi>Rome,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If then any man had byn present in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> to enforme truly those learned men of these,<note place="margin">Copy. of disc. pag. 82</note> and other such poynts appertayning to this fact; and aboue all of their pryde and arrogancy that being scarfe 10. against 300. at that tyme, they durst make so daū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a diuision among Catholikes in the sight of the common enemy, and in tyme of persecution, and that by no means ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of authority or gentle perswasiions

And yet is their definition (as before hath bin noted) so limited that they determyne only of the facte in it selfe, and this also according to the present information giuen them exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all other circumstance &amp; considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that do or may aggrauate the same, so as in very deed very litle reliefe cometh vnto our brethren by this definition of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> &amp; wel they might haue spared to prynt it, but that M.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:136"/> often they do professe in the two first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of their English booke intituled <hi>Copies of discoursss, &amp;c.</hi> and in their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the Doctors of Paris they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch the same) to wit, that their scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was only whether this matter came frō his Hol. or noe? and whether Cardinal Caetan the Protector abusing the Popes name had appoynted it of himselfe,<note place="margin">A false pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence.</note> and that they differed only to concurre with the rest of their brethren, vntil they might be a certayned of this poynr. If this (I say) had bin so, and not only a cloke or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to couer their designmēt of making sedition, it had bin a very easy matter to cleare the doubt by many wayes, yea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sending any to Rome, for that so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike an act as this vnder a Cardinals let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents might haue easily bin enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of without messengers; &amp; one letter of their owne eyther to his Hol. himselfe or to Cardinal. Aldobrandino his nephew or any aquaintance of theirs that was in Rome might soone haue procured them a certificate of this matter if they had byn desirous to haue knowne the truth. Yea further no man was there if the contrary part it selfe, which in his behalfe would not haue endeauored to ptocure them satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:176260:136"/>
            <p>But when it was seene and vnderstood that they rested not heere, but intended a further diuision, and that by geuing out, that they would send mē to Rome to cōtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and ouerthrow the whole, they sought to hould men in suspence from obeying their Superior, and to terrifie others, least it might be recalled that now they admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; that they sought by all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to cal in question and discredit, both the Cardinal his letters, authority, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yea the fact of the Pope himselfe, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he could not do it without thē, except he violated the Church Canons. And lastly that this authority was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne or forraine iurisdiction &amp; cōsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the admission therof subiect to the law of <hi>Premunire.</hi> VVhen these things (I say) and such like were hard of tending to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest disobedience diuision and sedition, thē did men of iudgemēt see and discouer, that the former pretēce of informing them selues of this Hol. wil, was but a maske to couer their further intentions, as since hath appeared,<note place="margin">M.

            <p>VVherfore his Hol. being at that tyme in <hi>Ferrara</hi> and aduertissed from his <hi>Nuntij</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
<pb facs="tcp:176260:137"/> in Frāce as Flāders, as also by diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principal English both in Engl. &amp; the low coūtryes of these attēpts and intents of these troublesome people, and considering what had passed a little before in Rome, the obstinacy they had shewed in their styrres there, and seeing further many let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters comming daylie to the Protector; of this matter; he was not a little moued therat, and calling to him one day <hi>F. Bellarminus</hi> (now Cardinal) asked him if he had heard any thing of this matter from Rome who denying to haue hard, his Hol wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him presently to wryte to F.

This letter was of the 17 of October 1598. which letter F.

            <pb facs="tcp:176260:138"/>
            <p>These things (I say) comming to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors eares &amp; by him related to his Hol. who now was come from Ferrara and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned with the memory of informations he receyued there from other parts, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to restraine this scādalous maner of proceeding and the hurts therof ensuing to the English cause, by cōmanding these troublesome Agens to be retyred to the English Colledge there to be examined quietly and comodiously by one of his owne officers to see what they could say,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Signor Aca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritius squar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionius</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of S. Iohn La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans.</note> or what they brought with them worthy of so long a voyage, or of so much noise as they had made by the same.</p>
            <p>This then is the haynous fact which our discontented brethren since that tyme haue so much exaggerated throughout the world by clamours, and do at this present both amplifie and vrge in these their books against his Hol. the Cardinals and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally F. Persons as the author and Architect of all (for so they tearme him euery where) indeuoring to bring the enuy of that which they dare not lay openly vpon his Hol. and the Cardinals to fal vpon him, wheras not withstāding, as presently shal be shewed, the cheefe informations against these men came from others and not any way from F. Persons but rather that he (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:176260:138"/> all their stomake and malice against him) serued them for a moderator and mittigator both of their imprisonment, examination and sentence against them, as appeareth by the particulars set downe in his former letters to M. Bishop himselfe,<note place="margin">F.P. letter to M Bish. 9. Octob. 1599. §. 10. 11. &amp;c.</note> and we shal also proue it more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>And first who doth not see that it is an ordinary art of all malecontents, and such as doe or deserue euil, to lay their il suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses vpon other men, and when they dare not do it vnto princes or suppreme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates themselues, they accuse common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such and such particular men, as they imagine to haue procured the same, or iudge to be against them, or mislike their doings.<note place="margin">The fashiō of all male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents to accuse other men for their ovvne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note> But this euery wise man seeth to be but a shift &amp; figuratiue maner of speech to accuse the said prince or magistrate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another mans person, or as the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to wound them through other mens sides, seing it should be a great blot to their wisdome and authority to gouerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by the passion of any particular mā, especially in this our case, his Hol. and the two Cardinal being so learned and wise would neuer haue bin brought by F.P. persuasiō (if he would haue persuaded thē) except they had seene greater ground then
<pb facs="tcp:176260:139"/> his will or words alone; and afterward when they were retyred, and his Hol. had appoynted a speciall officer to exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne them, and to bring the said examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnder their owne hands and others to be vewed by the Cardinals and his Hol. most certaine it is if these mē had brought with them any substantial or iust matter, for their contradiction and comming to Rome, they should haue had iustice, &amp; if not the falt should haue bin theirs and not F. Persons which had no voice eyther in the sentence giuen or vew of the said examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs. VVherfore to cry out so much of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice done thē both in their imprisonmēt &amp; the sentence giuen against them, and yet not to accuse his Hol. or the Cardinals but F. Persons only as though he and not they had done it, or that he gouerned them, is a cauillation which euery chyld can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer. And yet for better declaration of the one and the other of these points (to wit as wel for their imprisonment as that which ensued therō) we are enforced heere for defence both of his Hol. the Cardinal protectors and other officers much slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered therby to enlarge our selues a littel further in this place.</p>
            <p>And first concerning his Hol. intention to imprison them in <hi>Ferrara</hi> if they had
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:176260:139"/> come thither which our brethren make <hi>to be a strange and vnreasonable matter, that his Hol.</hi> (say they) <hi>should determine to put two priests in prison for comming to Rome with so greate aduenture and daunger of lyfe about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church, and this before he hard them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Copy of discorses, pag. 74. 75.</note>
               <hi>what they had to say, or saw them.</hi> This, I say, is a pore obiection, for if they came to trouble the Church of Englād with neuer so much aduenture or if these things were true, which before we haue mentioned to haue byn wryten out of England against them, to wit that they went about to set diuision and to discredit both the protector and his Hol. in their subordinatiō appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then might he wel determine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayne them for this disobedience at their first arriual, and yet heare them also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if they had any thing to say, and this is a course vsually held in all princes courts of the world at this day.</p>
            <p>But now let vs see what other letters also there were from principal English men in Flanders and other places; out of England,<note place="margin">Principal English men vvrote to Rome against the tvvo mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers.</note> requyring iustice and some seuerity at his Hol. hands against theese priests for their audaciōs and scādalous attempt to disturbe the peace of the church of England. And surely though the least part perhaps of
<pb facs="tcp:176260:140"/> those letters haue not come to our hands that were wrytten to his Hol. or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in this behalfe, yet by those that we haue seene, the sense and feeling of all good Catholikes of our natiō may easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in this affayre.</p>

                  <hi>Etsi non dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, &amp;c.</hi> Albeit I do not doubt but that your grace hath byn aduertised by many principal Cathol. mens letters of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the attempts of a certaine few sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in England against the authority of the Archpriest instituted from his Hol. by your letters and how that two of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:176260:142"/> of them, are in their way to Rome to contradict the said authority &amp; iurisdictiō by calumniations and clamors, yet haue I thought it also my duty, being appoynted to be a consultor in our countreys affayres to his Hol. Nuntio here to wryte somwhat also of the same matter. VVherfore my opinion is (if it be of any valew) that this very first beginning of this new sedition be repressed by his Hol. with some seuerity, least it take deeper roote. For if those cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of new trobles do fynd any fauour or toleration of their attempts in Rome, they wil styrte vp great stormes in Englād, but if they be kept downe with some sharpnes now at the beginning all wilbe quiet, &amp;c.</q> Thus he wryteth and much more and we leaue out for breuityes sake many good and substantial reasons which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth for the same.</p>
            <p>M. D. Pearse also Doctor of Sorbon as before hath byn touched, and consultor in like manner with Doctor Stapleton and D.

               <q>Your grace I know doth wel se how great mischief this matter is like to bring vnto our English Church if it be permitted, and how great trouble and molestation it wil breed vnto your grace (in gouerning vs) except as we hope reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be put by diligence at the beginning. For this disease is so much the more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous by how much the more secretly it infecteth.

            <p>By these then &amp; other letters that came to his Hol. or to the Protector about this tyme and were related to his Hol. by him, euery man may se whether he had iust cause to be moued or no, and to resolue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them at their arriual, but much more, when after 17. or 18. dayes stay in

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176260:144"/> set forth in print in one of their late libels, we know not with what reason, but only as they haue done other things to make a shew with heaping matters togeather, for that the letter proceedeth very substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, referring it selfe in all points to origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and publike testimonies. And albeit these men haue published two answeres to the same; the one of M. Bish. himselfe, the other of a censurer, calling himselfe M. I. B. yet neither of them answereth any one substantial poynt conteyned in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with satisfaction of a iudicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader, as wil appeare also by this which heere we are to set downe, offering for proofe therof eyther the publike testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes of his Hol. the two Cardinals Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, Acaritius the Popes fiscal, &amp; other parties that were actors or priuy to the cause, or els the depositiōs of the said mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers themselues vnder their hands and oathes, or finally the witnes of the whole English Colledge and nation that know what passed in this matter, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner of proceeding then to publish things in corners by way of libels without any further ground of truth, then the wil of malice of the publisher.</p>
            <p>First then touching the occasion of their imprisonment and his Hol. resolutiō therin,

And as for their courteous &amp; gentle vsage in the Colledge, while they were there, and all kind of frendship and charity bestowed vpon them (excepting only their liberty restrayned by higher authority) of these and other points touched also by F.

But when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they came to the substantial points of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176260:145"/> their message &amp; commission in deed, then was it seene how poore a iorney these men had taken, &amp; how smal substance they had, for that which they had takē in hand. And albeit M Bishop in his answere to F.P. letter sticked not to auouch in the word of a priest that there was little asked them about the substantial points of their affaire,<note place="margin">Bad shifts.</note> yet is his owne deposition and his followes extant vnder their owne hands to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, wherof we haue seene an authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal copy.

               <q>The cause of our comming to Rome was this, that we might beseech most humbly and with all obedience the Sea Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that this order appoynted by Cardinal Caetan for composing controuersies in England and to make peace, not being hitherto confirmed by his Hol. as we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:176260:146"/> it is said by diuers priests and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely F. Sicclemore and others;<note place="margin">The causes of this mes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sange to Rome.</note> might be mittigated or chaunged, or some other order appoynted with it, for satisfaction of <hi>very many priests</hi> who do thinke (reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notwithstāding due honor to the Sea Apostolike) that by this way appoynted only the strife begon cannot so wel be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Quam plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotis.</note> &amp;c. but yet if it should please his Hol. to confirme this order already appoynted by his authority, and to admit no other, then are these priests cōtent to yeild all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, &amp;c. And as for the Superior ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted; I spoke with the Archp. before I came forth, and desired him not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me, if I went to Rome about this matter, and he gaue me leaue to goe &amp; to deale for the chaunge therof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he said, which how true or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or coherent it is to that which since they haue said, done, and set forth in their bookes, I wil leaue to the reader to iudge, only noting out certayne poynts to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. And first to begin with the very last our Archp. denieth that he gaue him licence for that he saw no iust cause; but only that he would not forbid him to go to Rome, which argueth also that he held no heretical proposition, <hi>that it was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to appeale from him to his Hol.</hi> as these men
<pb facs="tcp:176260:147"/> haue talked abroade. Secondly the same is much confirmed by the answere of M. Bishop this mans compartner in these words: <hi>Bis visitaui Archipresbyterū solus, &amp;c. I visited twise the Archpriest alone and tould him of my comming to Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exam. G. Bish. 10. Ian. 1599.</note>
               <hi>and he asked me why? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to informe the Protector and to seeke a moderation of his authority. He persuaded me the contrary, but not prohibited me.</hi> Now whether it be probable that the Archpriest would giue licence to the one of these messengers and not to the other, is not hard to gesse nay the matter is clere by an expresse let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written by the Archpriest the 17. of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust 1598. vnto the two messengers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The letter begvnneth thus. <hi>Rationem positam iteneris vestri satis acurata consideratione perlustrauimus.</hi> VVe haue examyned with diligent consideration the reasons alleaged by yow for your iourney to Rome, and we do not fynd that yow bring any thing which in my iudgement seemeth to be of moment, &amp;c. Thus he saith wherby we may perceue how he did allow of their iourney. But now let vs passe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of other poynts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Exa. Rob. Ch. 15. Ian. 1599.</note>He sayth heere that very many priests <hi>quam plures Sacerdotes</hi> were not satisfied with his Hol. order, which speech of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priests he doth explicate afterward
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176260:147"/> what number it might import in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, being pressed therevnto by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory in these words: <hi>Interrogatus, &amp;c. respondit, &amp;c. being asked what the number of Priests now in England seemed vnto him? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he could not tel for certaine, but he thought</hi> 300. <hi>more or lesse.</hi> Then being asked <hi>how many of these he did certainly know to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue this their mission, and to be priuy to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that should be proposed, and would stand to those things that these two should hādle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in their names. He</hi> answered. <hi>I do know for certaine more or lesse</hi> 14. <hi>or</hi> 15. <hi>albeit I haue not had conference with them all my selfe &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But M. Bishop doth not arriue fully to that number in his answere to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory for hauing said also that he thought 300, priests to be in England,<note place="margin">Exam.

            <p>This matter also of the smal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of contradictors at the beginning is not a litle confirmed by the relation made by M. Charnocke in his depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <q>The first that were called by the Archpriest to conferre his new authority with all were (as far as I know) M.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176260:148"/> pretended, we see also that the priests could not be many; nor of great accompt, that resolued this embassage to Rome, against the Archpriest and the rest of the Cleargy.</p>
            <p>M. Bishop also being asked about his mission who sent him? with what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? why he &amp; his fellow were sent aboue the rest? and other like poynts was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled in answering, saying. <hi>Nescio quis fuerit, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exam. G. Bish. 10. Iā. 1599.</note>
               <q>I know not who was the first author of this mission, nor know I for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne why we two were chosen for this mission aboue the rest. One of the Priests named M.

            </p>
            <p>These are his owne words, and by this we may preceaue what an authentical mission and commission this was.</p>
            <p>But yet further to say a word or two of the very cheefe poynt of their commission
<pb facs="tcp:176260:149"/> and cause of comming to Rome, yow haue hard that M. Charn. saith and sweareth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that their only comming was, <hi>to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate most hūbly to the Sea Apostolike, that if the forsaid order of the Archpriests authority were not yet confirmed by his Hol. as they had hard F. Sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemore, and some other had reported, that then the same might be eyther mittigated or chaung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or some other order appoynted togeather with it,</hi> so as now our brethren seemed not to doubt of the truth or value of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letters, nor were not yet growne to be so bold as to affirme that his Hol. could not do it without their consents except he violated the <hi>Canōs,</hi>

            <p>M. Bishop also being asked the reasons of his coming to Rome, he enlargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in six causes, VVherof the first is his priuate deuotion to that citty: The second to deale with his Holines for sending some Bishop or Bishops into England.

The fifth to compose the stryfes in VVisbich. The sixt to put in good order the Roman

In all which six causes, as yow see, there is scarse any one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth fully with the former petition or declaration of his fellow M. Charnocke, so as they hauing come so many miles togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do scarse seeme agreed in the causes of their comming. And so much of this, for that it were ouerlong to runne ouer all poynts; yet this in breefe, they affirmed both of them, that as for the Archpriest, they brought nothing lawfully proued against him eyther in learning, lyfe or mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.<note place="margin">A breefe Summary of the cheefe poynts of these mens propositiō.</note> And the like they affirmed of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits.

            <p>By this we may see that these men had a good meaning to preferre themselues, &amp; that the iorney of the two messengers to Rome was not without hope of worthie reward, seing they were to be Primats thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and to make as many other Bishops of their partners at their returne as should be thought conuenient, and perhaps this litle man might hope for a share also in such a common welth, And to shew how fit he was; it may be that he penned this worthie worke, as a Secretary of those Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods which these men held about their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres and new deuises.

            <p>This then is the second member of his discourse to wyt how to suppresse these Macheuillian practises as he calleth them, and the means is no other, but that which before hath byn set downe, that their two Embassadors to Rome; be made Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, with authority at their returne to create Bishops of their fellowes, and this he proueth must be done by the example of S.

            <p>This declaracion and confirmacion of his Hol. when it came forth, euery man was of opinion that all questions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersyes would be ended therby, seeing that nothing was pretended before by the troublesome, but only to haue certayne knowledge of his Hol. wil and meaning.

I haue seene diuers letters, and heard by more reports of diuers differences eyther begonne or continued there among brethren, and such as ought to be frēds; with more vehemency then I could haue wished, especially in such a tyme of persecution, as this is, many are scā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized with it, and our cause is defamed

                     <p>These and many other such letters were wrytten at that tyme, both by the R. Archpriest and his assistents, as also by F. Garnet, and others of the Society, and by many particular mē of the quieter sort, vnto their dearest frends about this affayre, wherby may be seene their true inward sēse and meaning conserning the same, to wit,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:176260:164"/> that they most hartily and sincerly desired and procured it. The other side also made shew of the same desire or at least wayes to accept therof, but whether it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly &amp; sinceer, or outward only for a shew to satisfie the world for a tyme (for that they had protested euery where, that vpon the first sight of his Hol. Breue they would yeild) this God only can truly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and must iudge when tyme shalbe,<note place="margin">Double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse much doubted in some that made peace.</note> and the most likely is that diuers of them meant plainly &amp; sinceerly indeed, though of some of them, it is doubted that they made the peace only in external shew for the tyme, assuring themselues, that there would not want some probable occasion afterward to breake againe, and to lay the cause of breach vpon the other syde, as in effect we see it did ensue. For that a new deuise being shortly after cast out, that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction must be made to them for some former hard speches vsed or wrytē against them in tyme of the contention, and that otherwayes their good names should be taken from them, this was a sufficient match to put fyre againe to all that which had byn raked vp before by the endeauour of the forsaid peace.</p>
                     <p>Now then all the question standeth in this, which part hath broken the peace or
<pb facs="tcp:176260:165"/> which was most like to haue desire to maintaine and conserue the same.<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy discussed vvho did breake the peace made.</note> For dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing of which controuersy we might vse that argument of <hi>Cassius: Cui bono?</hi> who are like to receyue most good or hurt, by the peace kept or broken? For the Archp. and the clergy ioyned with him enioyed by the peace all that they could desire, to wit quiet establishment of their subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, honor, reputation, rest, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and his Hol. confirmation of all their doinges. The Iesuits also had asmuch as they could desire, and were satisfied in all points as appeareth by their owne letters aboue recited. But on the other side ensued the quite cōtrari in all respects so as it could not be imagned, but that by this pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they receaued <hi>secundum hominem</hi> much greefe and inward indignation.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:166"/> it is very likely they agreed with him, that in no case what soeuer determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation should come from Rome, peace should be made or kept with the Archp. and Iesuites which poynt it may be M.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:176260:166"/> first for the matters of VVisbich it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspected that Doct. Bagsh. was a great cause of the remoual of F. Edm. &amp;c. these suspitions are alleaged: First the day after D.B. was gone the minister of the Towne coming to the Castel, said, that D.B. tould him, that he looked to be remoued, or it were long and therfore it is thought that he was the cause of his owne remoue. Secondly, presently after D. B. depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he sent this message to M. Bluet, that the cause of his sending for was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning certaine matters which M. Bluet and he had oftymes talked of; and that he had not thought that those matters would haue ben brought to passe so soone as he saw they would; what matters these should be, but the remouing of Father Edmunds, &amp;c. we cannot coniecture. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by reason that M. D. B. sent to haue his portion of money as he had before, &amp; that it was denyed by many, and by M. Archer especially who said he could need no money that had 40.<note place="margin">This is he that vvas sent vp and dovvne to raise repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits Supra Cap. 6. &amp; 7.</note> crownes to geue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fisher, M. Bluet fel into a great rage, gaue him many oprobrious woords, and by multiplying of speches, he swore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, he would cal the Constable, which he did, but when he came in, he
<pb facs="tcp:176260:167"/> had little to say to him, but entertayned him curteously with a pot of ale. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he sent M. Archer this message, that if he did not come to submit himselfe vnto him before the next morning at ten of the clocke, before God he would wryte to the councel, for that he would not be hanged for neuer a knaue of them all. VVhether he did or no it is not certainly knowne; But this is certaine that M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, &amp;c, were remoued to the Towre not long after. Now after the remouing of F. Edm. the very Protestants themselues did say, that if in the castle they had not bin false amongst themselues F. Edm. &amp;c. had neuer byn sent for. Also both before their departure and after; some frends sent word that there was a false brother amongst them who had reueyled all the secrets of the house and byd them looke for troubles.</p>
                  <p>After the departure of F. Edm it went round that the troublesome fellowes at VVisbich were gone, and that the Iesuits sought to kil the Q. &amp; hāg D. Bag. who was a good subiect, as also to haue a prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence ouer the priests, &amp;c. This passing on M. Blu. M. Cauer &amp; M.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:176260:167"/> should be so, the rest proposed three things to thē, which if they would graūt, thē they should come with their good wil, other wise they would neuer consent vnto it.<note place="margin">The appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of some in VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Breue.</note> First to submit themselues to the Archp. to this they answered: They had appealed. The second was to liue vnder the same ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that the rest did, to this they answered they would not, for that they would haue no lawes but the lawes of the Church. They being asked who should explicate them, they answered, God would prouide &amp; sayd they doubted not but there would be meanes sufficient to curbe those that would not be quiet,<note place="margin">Tis is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be by vvay of the Councel vvith vvhome they dealt.</note> they were demaunded to tel, what that was, but they would not.

And towards the end of the next moneth after D.B being now returned (if he were not before) another priest wrote a letter in these woords.</p>

Your letters wrytten at Paris the 25. of May about your iourney into Englād were deliuered more slowly to my hand, then I could haue wished, both that I might haue answered sooner and haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that iorney of yours, if they had comme vnto me before yow were depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of France, for that I thinke the newes of your departure wilbe very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to his Hol. as it is vnto vs, for so much as it is both against obedience, and against an expresse prohibition, and against your owne promise confirmed with an oath, and is thought wil giue occasion of new contentiō &amp; troubles in England, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thus begā the letter, &amp; after he answered to all the obiectiōs or cauillatiōs which the other had touched about their hard vsage and iniurious sentence gyuen against them, and how he had appealed from the same. These poynts the good Cardinal answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:176260:171"/> with great modesty perspicuity and breuity, shewing the first two to be false and spoken without ground, and that the third about appellatiō could haue no place at all, the sentence comming from such as it did, and therfore warneth him to looke to his conscience about the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and censures incurred, and finally giueth him councel to returne to the place from whence he departed, and there make sute for the reuocation of his Hol. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer restraint, which the other little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing regarding as it seemeth; perseuereth stil, and doth to this day, in England, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise as we heare his function of priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood notwithstanding the censure of Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension so openly incurred, and vpon the 4. of Nooember returned to his grace an answere much more vndutiful then his former letter, which we heare also they are to print in which answere rouching their oath mentioned by the Cardinal, he sayth thus: <hi>quam licet tunc eluderem fraudem,</hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:176260:172"/> of his Hol. or Card Protector do presume to go to any of the kingdomes of Englād Scotland or Ireland for the tyme, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This was the decree: And it is strange that any Cathol. priest would aduenture to breake it so openly and to glory in it by wryting when he hath done. But what? did he attend to obserue the other part of the decree any more then this? which was that they should liue quietly &amp; obedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to procure others also to peace and concord: this may be seene partly by the effects that ensued his going in (for within 14. dayes after this his letter to the Cardinal there followed their greatest appeale from the Archpriest) &amp; partly the same may be vnderstood by his owne letters. For wheras the Archpriest was the principal man to whome and towards whome he should performe these good offices it appeareth by the first letter that euer he wrote to him after his entrance into England to wit the 24. of May 1600.<note place="margin">A quarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling letter of M.Ch. to the Archp. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vpō his cōming into Engl.</note> that he sought occasion to quarrel with him.

This is to request yow in charity to wryte to me, why sending for me to declare the Authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yow by Card. Caetans letters: yow shewed me such instructions as when I came to Rome, I found were not annexed to your commission as yow
<pb facs="tcp:176260:173"/> at that tyme said were annexed, &amp;c.</hi> And then he chargeth him with fowre particular points which the Archpriest denyeth that he euer said, that they were expressely in his instructions from <hi>Rome.</hi> And he that knoweth both the men, wil easily see, who of the twayne is most to be beleeued.</p>
                        <p>VVel after this followed stil worse and worse effects, stryfe, contention, contempt of Superiors iniurious letters wryttē both to the Archpriest and his frends. Appeales euery where from his authority aswel by them of VVisbich as other where abroad, which were heere ouerlong and tedious, yea lothsome to repeate. Yet may we iudge of mēs spirits in this behalfe, when 8. priests togeather subscribed a letter to their said Superior with this sentence in it among other:<note place="margin">A contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious letter of D.B. &amp; his fellovves to the Archp. 19.

                        <p>And this they say to him, hauing in effect giuen him the <hi>Lye,</hi> diuers tymes in the said letter before, and for that he had said in his letter to them, <hi>that the greater part of VVisbich</hi> (which were triple to these men) <hi>semed to him both the bigger and better part,</hi> they accuse
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:176260:173"/> him heere of no lesse then of blasphemious behauiour in that he taketh vpon him the part of God to iudge in such matters, who is the better part.

            <p>And this was the course held by the troublesome especially after M. Char. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into England, and in all this maner of proceeding yow must vnderstand that F.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:174"/> also how much they should pleasure and gratify the Counsel by this course. But if this place did permit to bring forth all the letters that he wrote in this meane space into England and other where, as wel to the Archpriest, and Superior of the Iesuits, as also to others on the other side for staying of the sedition, wherof these people that accuse him cannot be ignorāt, it would make men wonder how passion could so farre draw priests awry, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of the contrary. And we shal on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch a few, and those not wrytten to any of his owne, least the testimony might seeme partial: but to others which in this matter cannot be suspected.</p>

               <q>Good Sir, the peace and holy spirit of our blessed Sauiour be with yow &amp; vs all euer. About this tyme twelue moneths or somwhat ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I wrote to yow and to M. Mush at the ending of the affayres of our two frēds M. Bish. and M. Charnocke, at what tyme
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:176260:174"/> aswel vpon the assurance giuen by them, as also by the answers I had from England, all were in hope to heare no more of those dissentions, &amp;c. But now to our great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle we heare of new complaynts, and fresh contentions to begin againe about things past, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thus the letter beginneth which is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to be set downe heere, but after many other reasons and persuasiōs he sayth thus: I beseech yow good Sir &amp; the rest of your frends there, euen for Christs his sake and for the honour and reputation of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of our Catholike cause among strangers, &amp;c. Let this be an end of former controuersyes, let peace and vnion be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for the tyme to come.

            </p>
            <p>But some monethes after this againe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing that this did not auayle, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to wryte a very large letter vnto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne learned priest, with whome he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded himselfe he could do very much, and the said priest with them, or some of the cheefe at least. And in this letter he layeth downe all the reasons &amp; answereth all the obiections which he thought to be the principal about this affaire, he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus: <q>My louing frend it is now long

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:176260:175"/> priests from the iurisdiction of the Archpriest. The letter beginneth thus: Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Camerado,</hi> and fellow of our long ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">Father P. brought him vvith him out of Spayne to Rome.</note> is it possible that yow should so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your old frends and acquaintance as in 3. yeares not to answere any of myne? <q>But it may be yow want comodity of sending, &amp;c. About the matters in cōtrouersy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I wrote to yow long ago from <hi>Naples,</hi> and since againe from hence, persuading yow, and your brother to do some good offices, for making some good end, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde: as yow neuer answered me (at least wise I haue not seene any) so to my greife I haue not seene any good successe therein yet, but rather increase of further breach, which how preiudicial it is and wilbe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more vnto Gods glory and to our publike cause of religion, and to the reputation of all that labour in that vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and to the whole worke, no man can but see. Here hath byn shewed a certaine appellation of late, wherin both your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand and yours, and the subscription of diuers others my old frends and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are set downe. I wish greatly that yow and I might haue but one howres talke togeather, to consider of the reasons that might mooue yow and them to so
<pb facs="tcp:176260:176"/> publike an act, in such a matter, and such a tyme as this is, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this and many other wayes, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the effectual speches and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he made to all those priests he sent into England, which haue not byn few synce the Archp. was appoynted, and this controuersy raysed; may appeare this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sense and meaning and most earnest desyre of making and cōseruing peace, but the more he sought, sighed, prayed and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to this end, the more obstinate and eager were the vnquiet to follow their breaches, and with all to lay the fault ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vpon him.<note place="margin">The obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the vnquiet &amp; iniurious dealing vvith F.P.</note> And so finally after all their former resistance and appeales aswel of D.

Charn. and others abroad, they ioyned in greater number vpō the 17. of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber last (if all consented therunto vvhose names are subscribed, wherof we heare the contrary in some) in all which doing of theirs one thing is especially to be noted, that they haue neuer procured any one of all their appeales to be presented hitherto or prosecuted in Rome,<note place="margin">A special point to be noted.</note> as farre as we can vnderstand (which yet they ought to haue done within certayne monethes vnder payne, that all is voyd if it be not done)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:176260:176"/> nay further if the Archp. himselfe had not presented these appellations to his Holines perhaps he had not hard of them till this day, which is a token that iustice and trial is not sought by these men but gayning of tyme and liberty in England for the meane space from all Superiority. And further to shew their resolute determination to liue in continual stryfe, and not to stand to the iudgement and determination of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, they haue <hi>pendentelite,</hi> during the tyme of their appeale,<note place="margin">Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and vndutiful procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> &amp; before they haue receyued the sentence of their Superior, in preiudice of the said sentence when it shal come; altered the whole case &amp; published libels in printe ful of slaunder, contempt &amp; malediction, aswel against the doings and proceedings of the foresaid Superiors, as against other particular men conioyned with them and following their obediēce, so as when the said sentence of his Holines shal come forth about the forsaid appeale, which we expect daily if already it be not furth it shal fynd all matters changed to farre worse exulceration then before.</p>

            <p>In this very title and first page, fiue or six abuses sleights &amp; shifts may be noted to be vsed towards his Hol. which may giue a gesse of the truth in the rest of their bookes especially that in English which they might presume would not be so much examyned. For first wheras the whole world knoweth, that their controuersy is with the Archpriest as appeareth by their appellation to his Hol. Anno 1600. 17. Nouemb. &amp; others before; &amp; that their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make against the Iesuits is for stāding with
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:176260:178"/> him &amp; for him as by the whole discourse of both these bookes appeareth. Heere they change the whole cōtrouersy, and do say that it is <hi>with the Iesuits and M. Blackwel that fauoreth them:</hi> so as he is put heere but as an <hi>Appendix</hi> in the cause which is playne falshood.</p>
            <p>Secondly they put the priests of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries residing in England for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite part against the said Archpriest and Iesuits, wheras it hath byn proued in the former Chapter that these cōtentious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not the twentith part therof, by their owne confessions. Thirdly they say in this title that their contentions against the Iesuits began from the death of Card. Allē wheras we haue shewed before in the fourth chapter, by Card.

But hauing published it both to heretikes and Cathol. &amp; vsed the help and counsel of heretikes especially in the matter and not sent it to Rome at all, it is very manifest what they meane, and a playne mockery to put in their title, that it was exhibited by themselues to his Hol.</p>
            <p>Fifthy vnder the title they put this verse of the psalme.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psalm. 106.</hi> The great abusing of a text of scripture.</note>

            <p>Sixtly and lasty it is said in this first page that it was printed: <hi>Rhotomagi apud Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum molaeum subsignum Phaenicis:</hi> At Rhoane in France in the house of <hi>Iames Moleus</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the signe of the Phenix: And whether there be any such signe or man dweling in Roan we cannot yet precisely say, but haue sent to enquyre, yet in the meane space we are most certainly persuaded the thing in it selfe to be false, and that as rhe booke was printed without licence of any Superior (except perhaps the false Bishop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) and that it was printed in England it
<pb facs="tcp:176260:180"/> selfe sheeweth not only the playne En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish charecters therin contayned, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that themselfes in the end of the booke, for excusing the faults in printing say thus: <hi>Propter variaes horum temporum difficultates, &amp;c.

            <p>VVel then these six absurdityes, shifts,

The second to get their good name againe in forraine nations taken away as they say, by the Iesuits.

And the second in our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion wil fal out quite contrary, to wit that wheras they were not infamous before in forraine nations, nor knowne at all, now they must needs be, by these their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famatory wrytings.</p>

And further with what modesty can he say that this gouernment of the Archpriest was neuer hard of before in any countrey, seing it is knowne to be
<pb facs="tcp:176260:190"/> (and so the Cardinal himselfe telleth them an ancient title and dignity in the Church of Christ.

               </note> A bishop is lawfully giuen to them against their wils, whē the lesser part only reclayme, as it is in our cause.

And if this be altered in ordinary bishops, wherof the Canons do speake, and meane, then much more may his Holines apoynte an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Prelate, as the Archpriest is, with what authority and iurisdiction he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth expediēt, as daylie he doth his legats &amp; Nutioes being oftē neyther bishops nor Archb.

            <p>After this treatese of M. Champneyes,<note place="margin">A letter of F. Persons discussed.</note> they haue placed a letter of F. Persons wrytten the 9. of Octob. 1599. to M.

Persons to lay forth breefly the plaine truth of the fact, and so he doth. And albeit they haue set forth not only an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere thervnto made by M. Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but also a much more malitious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary or censure wrytten by M. I. B. yet is there not one iote of the said letter truly and substantially reproued, as by equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination wil appeare.</p>
            <p>And first for the Censurer I. B. to make himselfe matter to play, as though he were a cunning Cabalist in discussing of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, he deuideth the said letter into 24.
<pb facs="tcp:176260:192"/> paragraphes, and so leapeth from one to the other, forth and backe referring yow now to this and now to that, as yow may easily perceaue, his desyre is to dally &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the reader, and to seeme to say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, wheras he saith nothing in substāce, but only vttereth his gaule of spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that man to whome (if we be not deceaued) he hath more obligation then to most men liuing. VVe wil shew an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or two, and so leaue the rest to a more particular examination of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tese which herafter may chaunce to be made, if this do not suffice.</p>
            <p>He maketh a great styrre and so doth M. Bishop also, and often repeateth the same, that F. Persons contradicteth himselfe at the very beginning in these words: <hi>M. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, it being now diuers monethes since yow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from hence, and no one letter appearing yet from yow, nor from your frend, M.

            <p>Another matter oftentymes brought in and tossed vp and downe by the censurer, is, that a propositiō of heresy was obiected against the Archpriest in Rome,<note place="margin">Cap. 9.</note> wherof yow haue heard before what it was, to wit, <hi>that no appellation could be made from him,</hi> and secondly how substantially it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, M.

Blackwel withal, being a thing as we see neyther grounded in it selfe, nor prooued, nor affirmed, by any mā, but only cast out by hearesay, and tossed vp and downe to make a noyse as yow see. So as these men haue no scruple of conscience to seeke to defame their brethren, yea their Superiors; by what deuise soeuer.</p>
            <p>VVe do let passe the 21. reasons which this censurer layeth togeather by distinct numbers to discredit the Protectors letters, which his Holines afterward confirmed, and affirmed to haue byn wrytten by his knowledge order &amp; proper motion.<note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> VVe haue spoken of it before,<note place="margin">21.

            <p>VVherfore wheras this man, and some of his fellowes do often vrge against F.P. in this place and other where of our late good Cardinal Allen his sweet and gentle gouernment and loue which therby he got and retayned: Truth it is,<note place="margin">About Card Allēs manner of proceeding</note> that his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was such to giue what contentment he could to all men, both by letter and word, and a most honorable disposition no doubt it was, though he could not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by auoyd the euil tounges of all discōtēted, as the world knoweth and hath byn she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before by diuers letters and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes aswel of his owne as others.<note place="margin">Cap. 3. &amp; 4.</note> Neyther haue we seene ot hard of any letter of F.
<pb facs="tcp:176260:195"/> Persons, that hath gon in other style, then that which the Cardinal vsed. Neyther haue we spoken with any that could truly complayne of hard words in dealing with F. Persons. His actions also what they haue byn both in Spaine and Rome both to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifye, and pacify all are easily seene, but the difference is in the tyme, and our priests being greatly increased in number, and growen also in stomacke, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal being dead, whose authority they respected, and no other succeeding him in his place, that could punish by office or authority, yong men haue come; partly by multitude &amp; liberty; partly by inductiō of other vnquiet spirits to be impatiēt of rule, &amp; restraynt. And the selfe same motiue that induced his Hol. to giue thē a Superior, to wit lacke of order in so growing a body (which yet was not so needful while the Cardinal liued) inuited them to repyne at the same. And if the good Cardinal had liued to this day to haue consented as he would haue byn enforced to such a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in England for their restraynt, that would not be restrayned, he had had (no doubt) his part of contradiction, as the good father hath had, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with so open mouth, as against the father, for that they would haue feared

            <p>VVherfore to make an end, seeing these matters are like to be handled afterwards, againe as we heare, more largly to his Hol. &amp; particular matters better examined, we say that the bitternes &amp; inmodesty of these treateses against so worthymē of our owne religion do wonderfully cōdemne the spirit of the wryters, but nothing more then the exceding rancor vsed against this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, which so many wayes hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited both vs and ours. And to the end that the Reader may see how euidētly this proceedeth of the common ennemy, we shal make a particular chapter of the egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious iniuryes done vnto him by manifest slaunders &amp; calumniations which no doubt do proceed in great parte either by compact with the persecutors or els with intention to gratifye them therby.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The groūd of all greef against F. Persons.</note>The grounds of all the greefe and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke which our passionate brethren haue taken against F. Persons is, for that they imagine him to haue byn the first procurer of this subordination of the Archpriest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and the cheefe defender ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of since the institution, and particularly for that they persuade themselues that he was the principal cause and procurer of the restraint of their two messengrs sent to Rome.<note place="margin">Cap. 8. &amp; 9.</note> In which poynts notwithstanding we haue seene by that which before hath byn treated how farre they were deceyued, and that his Hol. had other grounds &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to do that which he did, besids Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Persons, albeit if the said Father had

But let vs passe to more particulars.</p>
            <p>In the 23. pag. of the latyn booke, where they begin to inueigh against F. Persons in particular they say thus: <hi>Quid intereà P. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Personius, alias Cubbuccus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A general calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō against F. Persons.</note>

Robert Persons alias Cubbucke a cheefe Iesuite, that is the author incensor and actor of all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations both at home &amp; abroad, &amp;c. So say these mē. And by this <hi>exordium</hi> we may see their spirit and scrupulous conscience, &amp; what care they haue of speaking truth or falshood ignomynies or contumelious reproches. If any one of F. Persons Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors were called also, vpon some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cause by that other name, what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that, or why is it brought in heere but only of malice? For we see it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing in Englād in diuers mē to be called by diuers surnames to wit so, alias so, and wheras there are many brothers, nephewes, cosin germans and other kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:176260:198"/> of F. Persons lyuing in Englād, no one of them is called by any other name then Persons so farre as we can enforme our selues. This then is no lesse impartinēt then the other is false and ful of iniquity, that he is the author, incēsor or actor of all their troubles, who of all men els hath sought most to quiet them,<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 10</note> as before we haue proued by his owne letters and other mens testimonyes; so as God must iudge in these calumniations offered.</p>
            <p>But there insue diuers others in the next page more particular and more shamelesse then these, the first is, <hi>that wheras F.

For first it is more then 21. yeares since F. Persons came into England, to wit betwixt Easter and whitsontide in the yeare 1580. Secondly for his actions in that tyme he remayned in England, they cōsisted in diligent teaching and preaching, and reducing men to Cath. religion through diuers Prouinces of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:176260:198"/> Realme, as the numbers of principal men by him reduced do testifie, and the bookes wryttē by him in that tyme, as namely the <hi>Censure against Charke, the discouery of Iohn Nicols, the reasons of refusal of going to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testans Churches, a treatese of Pilgrimage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Books vvryttē by F. Persons in Englād.</note> and some others, vpon which preaching and wryting when many cheefe men refused to go to heretical seruice, there was called a Parlement in the end of the same yeare, &amp; the law of 20. poūd a moneth for recusan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vvas ordayned, but no capital law made against priests or their receyuers, vntil diuers yeares after F.P. was gone forth of Englād againe in F. Cāpions arrainmēt also, which was after F. Persons departure, there was no one action obiected of F. Persons in particular against the state, though he were knowen to haue byn Superior in that mission, as by the records yet extant may appeare. And consequently yow may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how many deuised vntruthes there be in this first particular accusation. VVe shal consider in order the rest.</p>
            <p>The second imputation is,<note place="margin">The 2. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniatiō against F. Persons. <hi>Ibid. pag.</hi> 24</note>
               <hi>that F.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:199"/> with him &amp; were priuy to his doings heerin, as also of other lay gentlemen that know the same. For better explication wherof, &amp; of diuers other iniurious slāders that are to follow, we shal be forced to repeat breefly some poynts about F. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons intētions and doings wherof we haue informed our selues, and might be omyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if these calumniations did not driue vs to vtter them.</p>
            <p>F. Persons being master of art and fellow of Balioal Colledge in Oxford, left the same about the yeare 1573. as we take it, and the next yeare after went ouer the Sea to trauaile and study in Padua, &amp; the next yeare after that againe, which was the yeare of Iubiley, he went to Rome and entred the <hi>Society of Iesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">F.P. first coming to Rome and entring the Society &amp; his first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Rome.</note> and 4. or 5. yeares after that againe to wit in the yeare 1579. a new Seminary in Rome being begon &amp; instituted, and aboue 30. English youthes dismissed thence vpon a certaine falling out betwene M. Doctor Ouen Lewes then Archdeacon of Cambray and after Bishop of <hi>Cassane,</hi> and them, the said Father procured their stay by the help of Father Toledo afterward Cardinal, who at that tyme was preacher to Pope Gregory the 13. and greatly in his fauor, and so an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made with Doctor Lewes againe.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:176260:199"/> And for better cōfirmatiō of the Seminary vocatiō he procured that the first forme of oath now vsed, was brought into the Romā Seminary, &amp; after that exāple by himselfe into the Seminaries of Spaine afterwards, wherby all promised to take holy orders &amp; returne to England when they should be appoynted by their Superiors, wherby we may see from the very begining and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since, what a furtherer he hath byn to priestly vocation and function, wherunto now these our brethren would make men beleeue that he were an enemy.</p>
            <p>And these breaches in Rome being wel accomodated by his sollicitation, the next poynt he procured, was to haue M. Doct. Allen called to Rome (as he was) to the end there might be a good correspondence set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led betweene the two Seminaries of Rome and Rhemes: and then himselfe in the yeare ensuing to wit 1580. being sent by Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the 13. togeather with F. Campian into England, at the sute of Doct. Allen in name of all English Catholikes who desired greatly the assistence of the Iesuits in that mission, F. Persons was appointed by his General to be Superior therof. And this was the first mission that euer the Society had into England.</p>
            <p>His actions in England were (as before
<pb facs="tcp:176260:200"/> hath byn 'declared) for the space of some yeare and halfe, or there about. to wit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the yeare 1581. at what tyme F.

Persons had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for diuulging of Cath. bookes being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and intercepted, &amp; himselfe being at that tyme in Sussex and hauing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of passage into Fraunce offered him, he had a great consultation with himselfe, and other graue Priests that were with him, whether he should go ouer or no, for better disposing of a certaine vrgent busynes in hand, which he could not wel do without his presence beyond the Sea, but yet with intention to returne as soone as might be. His cheefest busynes as we vnderstād were these that do ensue.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First he had diuers Catholike bookes &amp; treateses partly already wrytten, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begone in defence of Catholike religion, which could not now be printed in Englād his presse and printers, and M.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly he had many points of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be cōferred by mouth with Doct. Allen, as namely to hasten the editiō of the english new testament, for the which he had procuted him 300. pound of assistēce from certaine Catholikes his spiritual chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in England, the maner also of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning and holding vp the English missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as wel of Secular priests, as of the Society, for which the said Father had obserued diuers things of weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly diuers Catbolikes in England perceyuing the difficultyes of the tyme to grow on, and that they could not haue Cath. scholemasters in rheir houses at home as they weare wont had treated with the father to prouide them some succour or place of education beyond the Seas for their yonger children that were not yet fit for their yeares and learning to be of the Seminaries of Rhemes or Rome, which he could nor hope to do but by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence beyond the Seas.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly her maiestie of Scotland being then in prison in England, as she had procured, first that the said Father had sent a priest into Scotland named M. VVats, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:176260:201"/> after F. Holt, one of the Society to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the seed of Cath. Religion in that countrey to the good of her sonne the yong king, if it might be, especially now after the putting downe of the Earle Morton an heretical gouernor, &amp; of the aduauncement of the duke of Lenox to that roome being Catholikely inclyned, so had she procured also, that the said father had wrytten to Rome to haue some fathers of the Scotish nation in like maner to be ioyned in this mission, whervpon two beeing appoynted to wit F. Edmund Hayus, and F. VVilliam Cryton, it was thought very necessary, that F. Persons should passe ouer to Roan to conferre with them of their said missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before they tooke it in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly F. Persons had vpon his hands at that tyme two yong gentlemen M. George Gilbert and M. Charles Basset, whome he loued dearly, and who for the Cath. cause were forced to fly the land as persecuted and sought for by name, whome the said faiher could not wel leaue vntil he had seene them safely accommodated beyond the Seas which he did by his presence there.</p>
            <p>These then and some other reasons we haue vnderstood partly by the father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, &amp; partly by those with whome he cōsul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:176260:201"/> before he went ouer,<note place="margin">Vtilityes that in sued by.

For touching the first poynt, he set forth diuers good bookes in <hi>Roane,</hi> as the <hi>Epistle of persecutiō,</hi> both in latyn and English, the <hi>defence of the Censure against Charke, The booke of resolution,</hi> &amp; some others concerning deuotion. Touching the 2. poynt he helped much the speedy edition of the English Testament, with the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of future missions. Touching the 3. he obtayned a new Seminary for English youths at Ewe in Normādy with 100 pound pensiō a yeare of the Duke of Guise,<note place="margin">Seminary of Evve.</note> besides a house lent gratis by the Fathers of the Society, who also read vnto them, with diuers other helpes of diuers other French Catholikes, all which the said Father procured and established at his being there, and placed a gouernour ouer them of our owne nation, a graue ancient man named M. Chambers, which indured vntil the yeare 1588. when the said good Duke fel himselfe,<note place="margin">Seminary of S.

            <p>The fourth and fifth poynts, what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse they had euery man knoweth, for that
<pb facs="tcp:176260:202"/> out of this first mission to Scotland procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the said Father hath ensued the good number of Catholikes which synce that tyme Gods holy grace hath brought forth in that realme by his seruāts labours. And as for the two foresaid gētlemen Gyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert and Basset after great example and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of vertue much edification giuen, &amp; many good workes performed, they died most holily, the one in Rome, the other in Rhemes, hauing distributed first aboue 10000. crownes in almes, partly to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of Rhemes, &amp; partly to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Syon</hi> and other religious persons, &amp; pious vses.</p>
            <p>Now then all this being so, let euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man iudge, how vnworthy a slaunder it is for these our brethren, or him that wrote this booke to cal Father Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>ignauum militem,</hi>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:176260:202"/> by his iorney to the King of Spaine, by going also to Rome with Doctor Allen, &amp; procuring his aduauncement, for better strengthening of the whole cause, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly by his going into Spayne with great daunger of his lyfe, and procuring not only the yearly continuance of that kings assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the Seminaries of Rhemes, and after at Doway againe in those most hard tymes of the warres of France, but the erection also of diuers other new Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and residences for the English nation, as that of <hi>Valiadolid, Syuil,</hi>

            <p>All which we are forced heere to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member brefly for answering these sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or rather shamelesse calumniations of these our vngrateful brethren, who hauing neuer done any one iote in this kynde, but rather fed and byn nourished for the most part of them, vpon this mans labors &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, now obiect that against him, to wit, <hi>his going forth of England</hi> without which it is like they had not byn now priests nether without nor within England, for that if matters were wel examined, yow should fynd that many of them were sent in by him, and many more susteyned beyōd Seas by his endeauors.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:176260:203"/>
            <p>And as for forsaking the camps of God, we see by experience of temporal warre, how iniurious a slaunder it is against this man: For that he who retyreth only from the station of a particular souldier to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the whole tents, and to furnish from thence more souldiers, and other necessary prouision for the maintenāce and strēgthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the whole, cannot be said to haue forsaken the camp, but to assist it more then the rest. And thus much for this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation. The rest we shal passe ouer more breifly.</p>
            <p>The third accusation against F. Persons, is, that after his going out of England, <hi>nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam exinde destitit,</hi>

               <q>That he neuer ceased to exasperate the cheefe magistrats of the common wealth with wryting libels, and the temporal state of the whole kingdome by factious letters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This calumniation is refuted cleerly by that we haue said in the precedent chapter in answere to the third demaund of M. Mush about prohibition of exasperating bookes where it is shewed,<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> that albeit he with the same splene and vntruth (as this man doth heere if he be not the same) doth name only F. Persons, yet he is the man
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:176260:203"/> amongst al other Catholike English wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for whose bookes men haue least byn called in trouble, so farre as we knowe. And we thinke our angry brethren cannot giue any one instance to the contrary, wheras for diuers books of Doctor Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Doctor Bristow, and Card. Allen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers searches, troubles, and examinatiōs are knowne to haue byn made, &amp; yet are they not so much as mentioned by these men, wherby is euident their passion, and that they seeke only cauillations against Father Persons.</p>
            <p>And wheras this fellow heere calleth them libels we haue told in part, what they are, and others may not so wel be named, and yet Catholikes know them, or can gesse at them. And one only booke amōg them, to wit, that of the <hi>Christian directory or Resolution,</hi> is knowne to haue gayned more soules to God, then all these men ioyned togeather can euer hope to do, especially with this spirit which now they shew. And wheras these men heere do note in the margent these woords, when they talke of exasperating books, <hi>Patris Personij liber de successione.</hi> They do shew maruelous rancor, and corrupt affection,<note place="margin">About the booke of Succession</note> and no iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or desyre of truth at all. First for that it was neuer hard of in England, that any
<pb facs="tcp:176260:204"/> special persecution was made for this booke. Secondly they do not know but by their owne presumptiō, that this book is more to be attributed to F. Persons, then to the late Cardinal Allen, Sir Frauncis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glefeld, and other principal men of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are knowne to haue concurred to the laying togeather of that book, as by their owne hands is yet extant, and this to the publike benefit of our Cathol. cause: First that English Catholikes might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what special and precise obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they haue to respect religion in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any new prince aboue all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects humayne vnder heauen, and this is handled largely, clearly, &amp; with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of learning, reasons, doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples throughout the first booke. And in the second booke is shewed to the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the great diuersytie of pretenders that are or may be after her Maiestie that now is, to the Crowne, euery man and woman in their rancke and degree, allowing to euery one the vttermost reasons that may be for them offering iniury to none, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of any, but leauing all in suspēce to this only end, that catholikes seing their obligation; and beholding also their variety of choise in some cases might resolue of that, when tyme cometh which shalbe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:176260:204"/> most conforme to Gods glory, publike weale, &amp; their owne foresaid obligatiō for their soules. And this being the but of both these books, let wise men consider the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of these people, that make so much ado about it.</p>
            <p>The fourth manifest calumniation or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fiction against F. Persons is heere set downe in these words:<note place="margin">The 4. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniatiō against F. Persons. Pag. 24.</note>

Nay why haue not those of the Councel or some other heretical wryter, published some one letter of his in all this space of 21. yeares since first he was sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England &amp; hath dealt euer since in this affayre?<note place="margin">Euident resolution.</note> Diuers letters of other men inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted haue byn published in print to seek their disgrace as all the world knoweth.

VVherfore it is easily seene with what spirit these men are gouerned, seing they would gladly make F.

               <note place="margin">The 5. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniatiō against F. P. lb. pa. 24.</note>The fifth calumniation, which might be deuided into diuers, doth contayne a great rabble of fond and false obiections against F.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:176260:205"/> F. P. his imprudence and audacity abroad</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are greuous accusations if they were true, and being false are the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious reproches. Touching F. Persons therfore, it hath byn shewed and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he hath done nothing abroad to the preiudice of them at home, but rather much to their good. And as for these men, how much they are vrged or pressed by the temporal magistrate, the effects do shew, seing they are knowne to haue special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto them; &amp; fauor with them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, not only for their owne ease (those of them that be in prisoo) and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for them that liue abroad, but for the afflicting also of their Cathol. brethren in durance, that do not allow their seditious course; so as this accusation of their suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for F. Persons doings and wrytings is both euidently false in it selfe and very calumnious in the cause therof.</p>
            <p>The sixt accusation in this place is,<note place="margin">The 6. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniatiō against F. P. Pag. 24.</note> that F. P. misliking the new association attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by these men in England did go about to defame them with the schollers of the English colledge in Rome, as though they had sought their owne preferment by that association and to be made Bishops &amp; the like. But for answere of this we remit the
<pb facs="tcp:176260:206"/> Reader to that which we haue aleaged before out of the common letter of the 6. Assistants to the <hi>Nuntio</hi> in Flaunders about this matter;<note place="margin">Sup. cap. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> as also what hath byn cyted out of their owne wrytings &amp; testimonies before, for making Archb. their two mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers &amp; other of their company bishops, at their returne. All which being conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red F. P. wil easily be deliuered from this calumniation, and themselues condemned. And thus much for the accusations in this place and page heaped togeather against F. Persons.</p>
            <p>There do follow many more infarced throughout the whole booke (for it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth their only or principal study was, and is to discredit this man, therby to get more credit perhaps themselues with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Bishop of London, and with some other principal protestants, whose fauour they vse in this cause) and so when they come so farre forth in their Story of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn book,<note place="margin">Diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst F.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:176260:206"/> of mynd can precipitate men that suffer themselues to be carryed away therwith.

            <p>
               <q>They wryte pag. 40. that F.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:207"/> wherby it appeareth, that the cause of their iorney was such as required not the hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Colledge which was only for pilgrimes, yet he would willingly receaue them, &amp; deale most frendly with thē in all respects, while they weare in the house, vpon one only condition, that they would not do or say any thinge to the schollers that might tend to rayse or renew sedition or diuision now wholy taken away in the Colledge. VVhich conditiō they breaking after some dayes F.

Doctor Haddocke, M. Martyn Array and others that talked with them to this effect. And the same wil testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all the Fathers and priests that remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then in the Colledge.

And first for that of Oxford if any such thing had happened in this tyme, F.

But we hauing enformed our selues diligently both from himselfe and others, and some of vs lyuing either then or soone after in the said vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity, are priuy to the fact it selfe, and do most constantly affirme all this to be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious

And as for the vniuersity of Oxford let the Registers be sought, and the men asked that lyued with him there in his tyme, and by them it wil be found, that he neuer had any con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Adam Squire afterward Sonne in law to the Bishop of London a man of knowne infirmityes (to say no worse) &amp; this for certaine deceyts vsed to some contrey men of his in selling them dycing flies, and other like toyes, which <hi>Squire</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding coming afterward by violence of the tyme to be head of Baliall Colledge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of F.

And this for the first poynt, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by is seene how truly they wtyte <hi>ex Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia Oxoniensi,</hi> that he was put out of the vniuersity of Oxford.</p>
            <p>Secondly for Balioall Colledge wherof
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:176260:210"/> he was fellow, and wherof these men say nothing (though they must needs meane it) we do affirme that in the forsaid yeare 1573. or 74. his voluntary departure thence and resigning vp the Colledge, is to be found in the publike register, of the said Colledge subscribed with F. P. owne hand, wherin it is affirmed, that he did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily giue vp the said Colledge &amp; fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with his right therin, with intention to trauayle, &amp;c. And in deed it is wel knowne that he had this intention to leaue Oxford and go beyond the Seas for some yeares before, and at this tyme especially he had agreed with some frends and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely M.

And this being so, how then do they auouch in this place, <hi>that F.

            <p>F.

And among others one <hi>Christopher Bagshaw</hi> Bacheler of art at that tyme, and a litle before by F.

               </note>F. Persons being gone to Lōdon at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stmas tyme, M. Bagshaw allured vnto him a very proper youth called <hi>M. Iames Hanley</hi> of whome F.

The manner of drawing him was (as we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand)
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:176260:211"/> by carrying the said youth forth by night being of very tender age, to certayne commedies which F.

Bagshaw which act being expulsion by statute to deny any scholler, to the deane, especially his owne (for F. P. as we vnderstand was deane this yeare, of the house) and he hauing no other remedy (for he perceaued M. Squire to concurre secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly in this deuise) he called a publike Chap. of all the fellowes laying open the iniury done vnto him. But M. Squire with the Protestant fellowes being farre the greater part began presently (omitting this matter proposed) to picke quarrels of religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst F. Persons saying that he peruerted a great part of the youthes of the house,
<pb facs="tcp:176260:212"/> and that it was not meet that a man of his backwardnes in religion, should haue so many schollers and pupils of that quality which his weare, and finally they exhot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that seing already he had treated to go beyond sea he would presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe his fellowship, and they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him such reasonable tyme for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiō as he should thinke good in which tyme he should haue all the priuileges of his fellowship and offices which now he enioyed. And further they would sweare vnto him (as there they did) to keep his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation secret, and if he would not do this, they all protested, that they would violently ioyne togeather to haue him out with all his schollers,<note place="margin">A great vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lence and iniustice offred to F.

            <p>This being proposed and stood vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, and their turbulent dispositions being wel knowne the Catholike fellowes which thē were in the Colledge namely M. VVilson, M. Turner now Doct and some others persuaded F. Persons, that seing he had made his resolution to trauayle, and that they offered him three moneths space
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:176260:212"/> to perpare himselfe, and to sweare secresy in the meane space, and that if they should furiously make this assault vpon him and his schollers, as they were determined, he should hardly get remedy at the vysitors hand, who was then Doct. Cooper B. of Lincolne, for these and like respects (and for that God as we persuade our selues did worke also secretly therin, by these euil mens meanes, to get that man out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glād) he resolued with himselfe to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his fellowship, and so resigned the same, as before is said and they taking their oath of secresi, the matter was ended, &amp; all made great frends, as to outward shew appeared.</p>
            <p>But in the lent following F.

Magdalyn, &amp; rung the bels backward as if fire had byn in towne, and being asked of the people what it meant, they answered, that a great Papist was fyred out of Balial colledge that day. And this is the true story of all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation which here is set downe, <hi>that F. P. was expulsed the vniuersity of Oxford with sound of bels, and with the greatest applause of al people.</hi> And the partyes herin named; and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to this day in good worship, namely
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:176260:213"/> M. Doct. Culpeper, M. Iames Hanley, M. Iohn VVilson eldest fellow at that tyme of the house, M. Doct. Turner, then also fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low &amp; others can and wil testifie, yet went not F.

And this was F. P. departure from thence: but how M. Bag. his accuser was driuen from thence after many publike broyles made therin,<note place="margin">M. Bag. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture frō Oxford.</note> all men do know, as also how F. P. was his chefest frend afterward at his going ouer the sea for his help and direction to Rome vpon his owne request, where he shewed himselfe to be the same man he was before and hath byn since, and for the same cause was dismissed also from thence: And so much of this.</p>
            <p>As for the other calumniation which followeth of the euil fame (as these men do speake) of F.

            <p>The rest that doth ensue about F.

            <p>And albeit this matter may be smothed (as all such matters of disobedience are

            <p>This course then being wel pondered, togeather with that which hath byn spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before in the 2.<note place="margin">An impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</note> Chapter about this affayre of disobedience, to wit how daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a point it is, it semeth to vs that euery tender conscience that hath part in this matter, may haue iust cause to doubt how he standeth and whether he goeth.

            </p>
            <p>The cause is as yow see, for that such men haue done iniquity in the land of Saynts: which whether England may now be so called or no, where so much suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is, so much bloud shed, so many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons filled with confessors: whether the Seminaryes also may be called the land of Saynts, wherin so many innocent lambes are brought vp in all vertue, feruour and deuotion to be sacrifices vnto Christ, in their due tyme; and whether the seditions and troubles mooued in the one and the other land by these men (both in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaryes we meane and in England) may be called iniquity, we leaue to other men to consider; and therby also to ponder, where and vpon whome the dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this threat of almighty God, may light, if the cause be not remooued.

            <p>Now let any man iudge by this letter (which came to our hāds as we were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Apology) how this matter goeth. Heere do enter (as yow see) all the peruerse and sinister meanes that can be deuised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst good Catholikes, by them that would seeme also to be no euil Catholikes, to wit, bribes, teares, treachery, false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:176260:227"/> calūniatiōs, exasperatiōs, &amp; subtile conuentions in fauour of heretiks against our owne brethren. M Bluet saith, he had spēt 12. poūd in 14. weekes, which is almost 20. shilings a weeke, which needed not in a poore prisoner but that perhaps he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to giue bribes to haue his matter more set forward though if the B. of Londō haue byn so liberal vnto him as men report, he shal little need to complaine as he doth of the want of the poore diuident of VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bich almes. Secondly he saith that he hath both swet and wept: swet in going vp and downe, wept in beseeching the Counsel to be of their faction, which he needed not in our opinions,<note place="margin">M. Bluets teares to the Q. and counsel,</note> they being no lesse desirous to set it forward then he, and beter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had his teares byn spent to God for his owne synnes.</p>
            <p>He saith he hath laid the fault of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in England, &amp; of her Maiesties offence, where it ought to be, that is to say vpon the Iesuits, excusing most of the secular priests. But if her offence be specially for the defence made of Cath. religion and the increase therof procured by them, then is this accusation of M. Bluets more honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Iesuits then he would haue it; &amp; all good secular priests wil geue him litle thāks
<pb facs="tcp:176260:228"/> for excusing them therin to her maiestie &amp; the councel as not offending in this behalfe But if he meane any other causes of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as practising against the state or the like, then is it calumnious to them both, First to all the Iesuits in England, who are no lesse innocent, vpon our consciences in this poynt then other priests, and secondly to the order of secular priests themselues, especially the better sort, adhering to their Superior, who are as innocent also in this behalfe as this mans (most part) which he would haue to be vnderstood perhaps those few of his side, &amp; so leaue al the other no lesse culpable and obnoxious to this slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as are the Iesuits, wheras it is knowne notwithstāding that whiles all other both priests and Iesuits haue bin quiet and silent in state matters, these men haue bin busy as farre as their power or credit wil reach or as any prince would harken to them or deale with them. And this apeareth for that they haue sent of thier owne mē euen vnto Scotland to deale with that prince in matters of succession,<note place="margin">M. VVat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vvas sent and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> and haue tampered also with the K. of Frāce by others of thier consorts to like effect, as the Lords them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of her Maiesties Councel cannot but know and at their going ouer into France
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:176260:228"/> we doubt not (and so we heare it already by some of their Counsel) but they meane to offer themselues wholy to that kings disposition for the next succession of our crowne, therby to gaine his grace and fauour, and yet they vaunt euery were that they and theirs are innocent in these affayres, and only Iesuits and their frends do deale therin. And so M. Bluet told the Q. and Counsel, <hi>and layd the fault where it ought to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The quality and maner of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding we shal better perhaps vnderstād if yow consider rightly that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the story of the blessed <hi>Machabies,</hi>

And a litle after in the same Chapter, when the said <hi>Alcimus</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Iewry; saw himselfe ouerborne by the same <hi>Machabies</hi> the scripture sayth: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersus est ad Regem,</hi>

               <hi>&amp; accusauit eos multis crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus.</hi> He returned to the king and accused them of many deuised crymes.</p>

            <p>Thirdly we may consider this end in respect of God himselfe,<note place="margin">The end of God in permitting troble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> who forseeing

               <hi>vt boni per eos exerceantur</hi> (sayth S. Augustine) that good men may be exercised by them. But what ensueth finally of all this, but only the perdition of them that do so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise others, if they desist not? which ought also to mooue vs greatly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The end &amp; issue of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy it selfe.</note>Fourthly &amp; lasty this end &amp; issue may be considered in respect of the matter it selfe, to wit, were it is like to end? what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to be the euent or vpshot of all this stryfe and contention? of all this wryting, speaking, defaming and exclaming by the discontented? Truly no other conclusion may be expected in our opinions (and this wil the sequel shew) but as when children haue fondly fought and wearyed themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and broken each others head they are forced to be frends with their hurts to them selues: and this is all the gayne which they gather by their falling out.</p>
            <p>Heere then is our censure of the issue of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:176260:234"/> this matter, that broken heads wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of all sides, but there may perhaps be some doubt or differēce of opinions, where most broken heads are likest to light? But he that on the otherside wil cōsider indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently who they are and of what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber condition and quality, against whome our discontented brethren so few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and greene in credit do make this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary warre he can not greatly doubt of the euent therof.<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest and his Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> For as for the Archp. his assistents and all the rest of the English Cleargy ioyned with them, being men of that vertue, learning and approued graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which all the world knoweth, what great hurt can they receiue at these mens handes, but only some little scratches in their names for a tyme (a thing of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and some exercise of their patience, as befote out of S.

And much more may this be said of the Iesuits who are a body conioyned by charity and rules of vertue,<note place="margin">The body of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits.</note> and dispersed ouer the world, and exercised in diuers places with like contradiction to this, wherby they grow rather in perfection of life and diligent guard ouer their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs, then be ouerthrowne or greatly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

            <p>And albeit some of them perhaps may be encouraged to go forward in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention by the applause or approbation which they haue found in some good men or women at this beginning,<note place="margin">Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon sinister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatiōs.</note> seduced or impressioned vpon their owne sinister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations; yet when matters shal come to more mature examination, and the euil effects before mentioned be seene and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, it is probable that these being good and godly catholiks and prudent people, wilbe of an other opinion, and by little and little enter into due consideratiō, whete authority, where obedience, that is to say, where gods part goeth; on which side order subordination and discipline do consist, where and with whome the body and multitude of our church stādeth, where peaceable or passionate mynds do beare rule.<note place="margin">Due consi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derations.</note> They wil looke also with tyme into
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:176260:235"/> the difference of mens lyues and maners, to wit where modesty, humility &amp; mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to be seene, what priests are giuen most to prayer, patience, longanimity of mynd, tranquillity of spirit, &amp; who to the contrary. They wil ponder also who are most hated and pursued by the ennemy for their labors and indeauors against them in the Cath. cause, and who are most fauored or tolerated by them? which is no smal marke to know how matters go.</p>
            <p>Truth also and falshood in asseuerations lightnes or grauity in accusations (wherby the quality of mēs cōsciēces is much discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) wilbe wayed and thought on in tyme.<note place="margin">Slanders &amp; calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs signes of a bad consciēce.</note> And when Cath. men shal find so many opē vntruthes improbable slaunders &amp; manifest calumniations vttered by passion in these their bookes as by no meanes or shew of reason can be defended or excused they wil enter into further cōsideratiō, what maner of priests these bee, how scrupulous or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of conscience, how they may trust thē in matters of their soules, that haue so little care of their owne, what secresy or assurance they may conceaue in matters committed to them, which concerne their liues states and honours (if after they should fal out with them) seing that vpon
<pb facs="tcp:176260:236"/> a little splene against others their brethren, they vtter what-soeuer they know, or haue hard, or can gesse or deuise, and that to the publike enemy, and to the whole world in print.</p>
            <p>These considerations then growing by tyme into the heads of prudent pious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes togeather with that other, that few or none, which euer haue yeilded to the enemy in one or two steppes,<note place="margin">Daungers imminent to the trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blesome if they go for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vvard.</note> could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lightly go back againe, but haue byn drawne forward, eyther by fayre meanes or force, to yeild in greater matters, and to discouer all they knew against their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrē, if not more. And that the examples of these issues are many at this day in England and that men set on passion and once disu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited from their heads and gouernours, by whome Gods grace descendeth, haue no stay or certainty at all in their doings, but do raunge heere and there as their passions lead them. All these considerations we say layd togeathet and many other which their wisdome and experience wil put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes are like to worke so with the better and grauer sort of Catholikes, as they wil haue little confidence in the doings or sayings of these men, if they go forward, but rather to accompt thē a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:176260:236"/> and wrangling people, daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to deale with all in these difficult tymes: and consequently wil fly them as much as they may. And this is the broken head which our brethren are like to gaine by this their wilful wrangling if they cease not.</p>
            <p>VVherfore to draw to an end,<note place="margin">The 7. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration about the necessity &amp; facility of reunion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> and not to enlarge our selues further in this matter, we shal for conclusion put two considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in one, to wit the necessity and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this reunion and concord, which we desire should be made among vs.</p>
            <p>And for the first which is the necessity therof, besides all that which is said and signified before, so much more may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, as this poynt only might serue for a whole volume. For what matter did our Sauiour inculcate euet so much vpon earth to his followers as this point of vnion and mutual loue: <hi>In hoc sciant omnes, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 16.</note>
               <hi>By this note shal all men knowe, that yow are my disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if yow loue togeather, and haue peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong yow.</hi> VVhat did he so much pray for to his father, as for this grace of vnion among his seruants: <hi>vt omnes vnum sint,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 17.</note>
               <hi>sicut tu pater in me, &amp; ego in te.</hi> That all may be one, as thou my father art in me, and I in thee. Behold what a vnion he requireth?
<pb facs="tcp:176260:237"/> And then againe in the same prayer, <hi>vt ipsi in nobis vnum sint.</hi> That my disciples be one (o Father) in vs. And yet further: <hi>vt sint vnum, sicut &amp; nos vnum sumus:</hi> that they be one as we are one. And finally: <hi>vt sint cosummati in vnum:</hi> That they may be perfectly one.</p>
            <p>This was his exhortation and this was his prayer. But what were his threats to them that broke this vnion? Truly they were most dreadful in all his speaches, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as wel by his owne woords in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels, as by the wrytings of all his Apostles and disciples. S. Iohns epistle may serue for all,<note place="margin">Ioan, epist. 1.2.3.4.</note> who being priuy aboue the rest perhaps to the spirit of his Master, denounced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the necessity of this precept of loue and mutual vnion, and reprobation and damnation to those that breake or liue out of the same. VVherfore of this we shal need to say no more, seing all the old holy Fathers ioyntly do exaggerate this synne of making diuision and dissention, aboue all other synnes whatsoeuer; as a thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the spirit of the diuel and most opposite and contradictory, to the spirit of Christ.</p>
            <p>As for the second point, touching the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of making concord and reunion againe, if men wil leaue of acerbity of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,

For we would aske our discontented brethren, that shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so mightely inraged, what is there which they would haue in this matter? who vexeth or vrgeth them? so as they may not liue quietly if they would? As for the Archpriest when the authority was layd vpon him which he in our cōsciences little thought of;<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> &amp; much lesse desired (for what may be desireable in such an office at this tyme) no man can doubte but that if these men would haue bin quiet, &amp; not haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted openly his authority, what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they had done secretly in Rome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise about it, yet would he neuer haue dealt thearin or vsed cēsure against thē for it. And when he was forced to vse cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, yet we see, that he recalled all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, as soone as they began in any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shewe to accomodate themselues; &amp; now no doubt if they would do the same after so many and manifest declarations of his Hol. wil for the continuation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his authority, if they would giue ouer this impugnation and liue quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to themselues, there can be no doubt but that he for his part would be very glad
<pb facs="tcp:176260:238"/> therof, and embrace them all as his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and children without any further memory of former amaritude.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Iesuits ready to peace.</note>The Fathers also of the Society which haue stood with the Archpriest and the rest of the body of the Cleargie of England in defence of his Hol. ordination, if by this they haue giuen greefe vnto our brethren, the recompence is soone made, and therby also the reconciliation.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:176260:238"/> be of reunion, if our brethren wil; and if they wil not, what excuse can they make eyther before God or man of this wilful breach and continuation therof?</p>
