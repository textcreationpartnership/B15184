            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the begyning also of this Q. dayes, the litle affection which the laity did beare vnto the Cleargy procured by some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet spirits, as also the smal vnion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Cleargy men amÅgst themselues some holding with the heretikes and politikes by heat of faction, was a great occasion of the total ouerthrow of religiÅ whervpon

For that euery tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate man wil easily see that it is great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of passion, not only to wryte and print contumelious matters in the pages &amp; leaues themselues, but also to decke the margents vvith ostentation therof; wherof here vve shal set downe some few examples.</p>
            <p>In the page 23. they make this general note in the margent: <hi>Iesuitae quae sua sunt, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> Iesuits seeke their owne, and not those things which are of Iesus Christ (for vnto that place of the Apostle they allude) but what shewe of truth hath this?<note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> or do these mÄ proue it in their text? no truly, no more then in the margent, and yow may see the place and shal find it so. Againe they note
<pb facs="tcp:176260:38"/> in the margent pag. 29. <hi>Iesuitici sedem Petri afficiunt ignominijs:</hi> Iesuitical men do disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and shame the seat of Peter; &amp; againe in the same page: <hi>Their propositions are impious against the Sea Apostolike.</hi> And may there be any probability thinke yow of this?</p>
            <p>Furthermore page 37. they say in the margent, <hi>that the persecution of Iesuits is more greiuous vnto them, then that of the aduersaryes,</hi> which perhaps may haue some secret true meaning, if the aduersary be he that setteth them on in this worke; and then pag. 45. <hi>Iesuits do trouble the peace of England,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation may come also perhaps from the same aduersary, who vseth it in all his wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and speches. And to the same effect they make another general note pag. 63. <hi>Iesuitae parum curant Ecclesiae tranquillitatem.</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits do litle care for the tranquillity of the Church, as who should say, that these men ioyning with the aduersary against their head and brethren, do care more for it, and more procure it.</p>
            <p>And finally not to spend more tyme in these trifles we wil end with one most odious note made against them, but indeed touching our selues and our countrey. The note is this, pag. 83. <hi>Inanis iactatio Iesuitarum de seminarijs Ã  se erectis.</hi> The vaine bragging of Iesuits of Seminaryes erected by them.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176260:38"/> But where and when and by whome of them in perticular,<note place="margin">Very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</note> this vaine bragging hath byn vsed, they do not set downe in their booke, nor cannot, as we thinke: but sure we are that the general body vvhich they touch by this woord <hi>Iesuitarum</hi> cÄnot haue bragged therof, for that all are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our Seminaryes, and they are men that comonly are wont to do more in such affaire then willing to bragge, and truly vve cannot imagine, but that this is some deuised bragge, inuented and brought in by our angry brethren, to gaule them withall, but indeed to iniury vs and our countrey, who haue receaued the benefit of so many Seminaries by them and their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and haue need of their help and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance stil, for their holding vp and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning, which these men would soone ouerthrowe vpon splene and emulation, if it lay in their hands. And by this act of so extreme ingratitude, they do what they can to that effect, but God (we hope) vvil defend his worke begunne, and restrayne their power in pulling downe, which haue no will to set vp or conserue.</p>
            <p>And with this we might end, but that in this place our brethren do vse so fond a calumniation against the Iesuits and so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously false as no man can but wonder
<pb facs="tcp:176260:39"/> therat; for they say that the new Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes set vp by the Iesuits in Spayne and Flanders, are not so beneficial to England as may counteruayle the hurts done by thÄ to the two auncient Seminaries of <hi>Doway</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi>

            <p>But what these other so great damages were or may be, which these men affirme the fathers to haue brought to the foresaid two Seminaryes Doway and Rome that were hard (I thinke) to ghesse, seing that of <hi>Doway</hi> receyued singular help by them at the very first erection, and namely that they procured the first hundred crownes of monethly pension to it from Pope Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:176260:40"/>
            <p>About Doway they obiect a new Statute of <hi>Card.

There are scarse two moneths past (as we are enformed) since this Seminary of Doway receaued 2000. crownes in Antwerp from Spayne procured and sent by F.

And what ingratitude then is it to accuse Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits for hurting this colledge, which dayly they do so greatly benefit.</p>
            <p>But these good fathers eares are now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to these vngrateful songes, and wil not be discouraged (we hope) therwith to perseuer and do vs good stil, seing they know now not only by Gods promises but by former practise also and experience that these blasts do blow ouer and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to the exercise &amp; trial of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and discredit of the doers.

            <p>For to let passe more ancient tymes and that conspiracy made against them in Paris in the yeare 1586. and 87. by some that had bin their owne schollers,<note place="margin">Bad vsage of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by EnglishmÄ</note> and others otherwayes obliged to them (as before hath byn touched) at what tyme there was a combination made by some of our order (an vnworty thing to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) with our open enemie Sir.

VVhich pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise when we priests vnderstood by the general lettres of the Superior of the said order in England bearing date the first of March 1599. we all or the most part of vs within the Realme (as also many without) thinking our selues boÅ«d in cÅsciÄce wrote to Rome most effectually against these shameful practises and our lettres are yet extant,<note place="margin">The Conf. of fisher 8.

            <p>And at the very same tyme some of our nation beyond the Sea being weary of their banishment and styrred vp (as it semeth) with the spirit of dissention and auersion against these men,<note place="margin">Diuers let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres vvryten this yeare into Engl. about this matter are yet extant and ready to be she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved vvhen need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</note> sought to make their peace with the Q. and Councel by offering seruice against them, wherof we haue seene sundry lettres wrytten in the yeare 1598. and in one of them no lesse then 15. articles suggested against Iesuits and how the Q. and councel might get them out of England by help of the King of France; to his Hol. which we might set downe in particular togeather with the letters and wryters therof, if we would follow the course of our discontented brethren and their consorts in this faction, but we meane to proceed more temperatly and spare their names for this tyme except we be forced in our longer Apologie to expound our selues further; only we say in this place, that it is an vnworthy and lamentable act for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike men to make their peace with the common enemy by offering to wound good men of their owne syde, &amp; religion, for gayning the others fauour.</p>
            <p>And by this in part we may vnderstand

            <p>And first of all I would aske our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that do publishe this to the world, so greatly to his discredit, vvherby such Princes also as were his aduauncers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors may take suspition of his former actions, and thinke worse of him now, when he is dead, then they did while he was alyue, what reasons or firme argumÄts can they shewe, for this their Asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

            <p>And to beginne from some yeares past, vve haue seene the latyn original before mentioned of the said Cardinal gathered out of diuers letters of G.

G. and E. G. and others, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176260:46"/> this faction was by name only against the Iesuits, but the principal intention against himselfe and all others, that ioyned vvith him in the publike aduancement of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause. For more proofe wherof the next yere after, he saw a large plot laid and discouered by a certayne letter of the afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said M. Morgan vvrytten vnto a Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian monke of the Scotish nation that had byn Bishop of DÅ«blayne, and residing for the present in the Duke of <hi>Sauoyes</hi> court, in vvhich letter was laid downe at length, &amp; vvith many particularityes, how the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction raysed against the late made Cardinal of England should proceed in their affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res by their agents in all Courts, as wel at Rome &amp; Spayne, as in France also, Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Sauoy and other places, and vvhat men of their side vvere fit, eyther English Scotish or other nations (for they meant to draw in all by these meanes) to be actors in euery of the said Courts: In this letter amongst other things, he vvryteth thus: <hi>The course of proceeding holden by the Cardinal of England, and his, is so violent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Th. MorgÄ to the B. of dumblayne 20. August 1598.</note>
               <hi>and their expestation so great, as all England and Scotland must obay and serue them, &amp;c. Yt is more then tyme that my L. of Cassano or some other be aduaunced, for the comÅ good, and to counterpeise the Cardinal of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and his, to help to conserue vnity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb facs="tcp:176260:47"/> in the handling of things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Consider this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Card. counted malitious by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> And againe. <hi>The enuy to my L. of Cassano, his merits and good gifts in him is maruelous great and the ground of all the malice, that the Cardinal of England and his do beare vnto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then againe making mention of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his faction (vvherof he seemed to accompt the L. Paget and his brother for the principal) he speaketh also of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named gentleman M. Tho. Throgmorton<note place="margin">M. Thomas Throgm.</note> thus. <hi>There is a gentleman of honour heere of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland a frend of ours very wel qualified, and is worthy to serue any king or prince that liueth, and I thinke him wel worthy, hauing all languages and qualityes as I haue said to be in the seruice of the Duke of Sauoy, if your Lordship can bestovv him vvel vvith the Duke he should haue honour and seruice therby, and the gentleman would be profitable in that place to his frends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much about the agent in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy vvhere they thought to do much (that Duke being sonne in law to the King, and put in head by them to pretend the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Flaunders insteed of the Duke of Parma, as the most part of this letter doth treate, &amp; many ielousyes are cast in, to set suspition betweene those Princes, and with the King of Spayne, but all against Parma) but for Spayne they designed a Scottish man Bishop of <hi>Vessun</hi> in Fraunce, nephew
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:176260:47"/> to the forsaid Dumblayne to be agent for English affaires, for that he was of their faction; to whose help and assistance not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding (for that F. Persons was gone thither the yeare before, and thought to be in good credit with the king) they had sent already one F. Arnold prior of the English Carthusian Monks in Flanders,<note place="margin">Prior Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold sent vnder hand into Spaine against the Card.</note> yet would not Morg. cÅfesse here so much to Dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne, least he should thinke his nephewes iorney thither to be but a shewe: <hi>VVe must suspend</hi> (saith he) <hi>our iudgment of the Priors si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all this while, trusting, that he wil giue vs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction at the last. I wrote vnto your Lordship, it was wrytten vnto me that the said Prior was gone to my Lord of Cassano I haue borne and do bea e not a little for his sake, whome the Cardinal of England, and all his, do so much mislike and there is great diligence taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue him and his bretheren (the monkes) at difference, which is a maruelous vngodly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus wrote this man at that tyme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising and setting downe agents also for all other Courts to oppose themselues against the Card. as my Lord of Cassano his ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phew and others ioyned with him or depÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that way in Rome, the lo. Pag. and his brother whith their adherÄts at <hi>Brussels,</hi> and as for the court of France he offered to
<pb facs="tcp:176260:48"/> lyue there himselfe. <hi>I haue</hi> (sayth he) <hi>vnder your L. correction assigned vnto my selfe my place (in Paris) which I desire to haue with allowance and good liking of your L. and continuation of my pension of</hi> 40. <hi>crownes a moneth which shal walke necessarily.</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. MorgÄs pension vvalketh.</note>
               <hi>The Duke of Sauoy and your Lordship are able to bring this to passe, and the King of Spaine at the Dukes meditation, and your L. labours wil confirme the matter, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much of the designment, but of the execution, the Card. saw another letter wrytten the next moneth after by the forsaid Agent in Spayne,<note place="margin">The letter of Prior Arnold 13. Sept. 1589.</note> Prior Arnold, vnto this same M. Morg. which letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyneth thus: <hi>There is wrong done both to yow and me (good M.

            </p>
            <p>By these words a mÄ may knowe a little the spirit of this Agent against rhe Card.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:176260:48"/> and Iesuites, but let vs heare him yet further <hi>In these letters to yow</hi> (saith he) <hi>I partly spoke of the maner of my skyrmish; but cheefly required yow to follow me with all speed possible vnto the King of Spayne, with whome I am now, passing first by the B. of Dumblaine who should haue procured yow the letters of the Duke of Sauoy and his bedfellow hither,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>By all this and much more that might be said (for we omit of purpose many other letters, or rather reserue them for our other Apology) it may be seene that all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot for many yeres was against the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb facs="tcp:176260:49"/> principally, and against the Iesuits and their frends as accessary only so far forth as they vvere ioyned with him, and that is ment when they say, <hi>The Cardinal and his,</hi> meaning by <hi>his,</hi> the Iesuits, for so M.

It had byn a good turne both for my Lord Cardinal, &amp; vs of the better sort heere that he had neuer come hither, &amp;c. I haue already said inough to his Prouincial, if that wil not serue, I suppose there wilbe further complaint of him,</hi>

               <hi>perhaps not so much to him &amp; his freindes contentment, &amp;c. By this trouble of M. Morg. I can assure yow that both of the best in England &amp; here be cold in affection towards your Society, the report being made in England by many Catholikes, that

            </p>
            <p>Lo heere all faults layd on the Iesuits by them that accompted the Cardinal their cheefe enimy, as before hath byn shewed. But now how the B. of Cassano himselfe tooke this matter, whome they had made their head and for more strengthening of him against the English Protectour, they adioyned <hi>Card. Mon de Vi,</hi> (procuring him to be protector of Scotland, for that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined him not greatly to fauour Spayne) this poynt, I say, is not so euident, albeit the Card. in diuers letters (wherof after we shal make mention) doth alwayes seeme to excuse him,<note place="margin">Hovv the B. of Cassa. behaued himself in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As for example in one of the 11. of December 1587. which vvas not many monethes after the Card. was made, he vvryteth thus: <hi>Haue pitty vpon my Lord of Dumblaine who I doubt is the more persecuted for
<pb facs="tcp:176260:50"/> my sake, yow know by whose meanes. Our Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of himselfe tould me, that notwithstanding the chyding of my nephewe, which yow know, yet his Grace and I shal euer be true frends, &amp;c.</hi> Here that he meaneth the Cardinal by vvhose meanes Dumblayne is said to be persecuted though without all cause (for that Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blayne did rather persecute the Card, as by many his actions and lettres doth appeare) is most manifest, for that no other can be imagined to be meant therby.</p>
            <p>And a litle after in the said lettre he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be commended by the Prior to <hi>Don Iohn Idiaquez</hi> the king of Spaynes Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary (as he calleth him) by the said Prior to some higher prefermÄt he wryteth thus: <hi>If yow wryte to S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohn Idiaquez excuse me that I wryte neuer to his honour for modesties sake, least I should seeme importunate for my selfe, but when he doth me a good turne he shal haue letters from me and others inough to thanke him, and shal haue honour and ioy by me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Bish. of Cassan. his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note>
               <hi>And truly I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mÄber him daylie at masse; if he knew the meanes that are wrought to persecute me and blynd the world, he would loue me aboue all my nation, to the which truly I haue done more seruice then all others of them, be it spoken to the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the good man wrote complayning of his persecutions as yow see and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his owne merit before all others of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:176260:50"/> the nation, by which his discontentment and emulation is more discouered, then were to be wished, which seemeth to haue growne afterward rather then to haue byn diminished, for that the next moneth and yeare after, to wit the 2. of Ianuary 1588. he wryteth thus amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to the same man, hauing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his former letter to deale with <hi>Don Iohn de Idiaquez: what yow wryte to Spayne to the good Secretary, and my L. Duches of me, I know it shalbe louing and modest and if there were therin a few lynes pithie, and short and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual separately wryten as your owne attestation to be shewed to the king it were vvel that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary if he listed might read it to the king, Truly this ambition of the monopolie of all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synes of our nation is a very daungerous thing, and I knovv they cannot do yt, and are not so fit as they thinke, to do all alone.</hi> This said the good man. And by this we may see how daungerous a matter emulation is, and how by litle and litle it taketh roote &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, If the good Bishop had neuer said nor wryten more then this in appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing these mÄnes dealing against the Card. from him, it had byn sufficient, not only to foster but to inflame their humours to go forward they being so vnquiet and restles spirits as may appeare, and desirous
<pb facs="tcp:176260:51"/> to swymme against the streame and hold a faction against the good Cardinal.</p>
            <p>VVherfore to go forward in declaration of our Cardinals knowing and discerning this faction to be against himselfe; and the common cause, there be extant two long letters of his vnder his owne hand to the forsaid gÄtlemÄ M. Th. Throgmort. wryttÄ the next yeare after to wit 1591. for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiÅ &amp; reuocatiÅ, if it would haue byn, from the said partiality; In which letters amÅg many large discourses, he saith thus: <q>It is wel inough knowne,<note place="margin">Card. AllÄs letters of the 4. Ian. and 30. of Feb. to M. Th. Throg. an. 1591.</note> that the things, vvhich haue byn done by that faction were neuer done against me for any particular or personal respect of myne owne, my selfe neyther before my promotion nor after, neuer geuing them any occasion in the vvorld of offence; But were rather done to the offence and special hurt of the commÅ cause, as to giue yow example, to draw from me my schollers vvhen I was in lesse degree then now I am, and to imploy them in publike seruices, yea such whome I knew to be discontented and disloyal to me, then their Master, as G. G. and diuers other priests, whome the world hath now discouered, all which were set a vvorke to their owne destruction, and ruine of the cause, &amp;c. And when it pleased God of his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176260:51"/> prouidence to induce the Pope and King to put me in this place, for Morg. and his faction to be so bold to addresse a special messenger the poore vnfortunate Prior of the Carthusians vnder pretence of other busynes of his order and house to deale openly with his Maiestie against me, and vnder pretence of my eyther insufficiency, or il dealinge in the comÅ affayres, to make supplication that another might be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the like dignity and opposed against me and my doings and followers, was not this a matter of comly quality,<note place="margin">Treason against the common cause.</note> or can yt otherwayes be accounted then a plaine treason against the common cause.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That againe some like discontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons after the death of the said prior, and MorgÄs imprisonment haue sought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade some about his Maiestie that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or fayned diuision of our banished countreymen rose vpon the difference of English and vvelsh Prouinces, &amp; that the remedy therof vvas to haue a Cardinal also of that part to ballance the matter as though it was alwayes necessary in EnglÄd that theere shold be one English Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,<note place="margin">Good councel of the Card. to M. Tho. Throg.</note> and another vvelsh Cardinal or els none at all, &amp;c. And in the end he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vvith him thus: It shalbe euer good for yow (M. Throg) to follow in this kind
<pb facs="tcp:176260:52"/> the mayne streame, and the principal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes of your nation with so many of the best and greatest without comparison of the nobility, Cleargy, and religious, and not to cast your selfe into the creekes of a few, and very few discontented persons, who are not yet so many nor of such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, eyther at home, or with such Princes abroad as to counteruayle the number of those that mislike the dealings of these <hi>left handed men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Left han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men.</note> neyther yet inough to giue the name vnto a faction of a whole nation, as though the English vvere indifferently deuided among themselues, about these matters, vvhich is altogeather vntrue, and in a manner also impossible, though some of folly or fraud may geue it out &amp; others of simplicity beleeue it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus wrote the Cardinal to this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and at the same tyme he wrote also seuerally to M. Ch. Pag. a large letter, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding first F. Holt in very earnest &amp; honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tearmes as he wel deserued,<note place="margin">Card.

                  <hi>VVhere of</hi> (saith he) yow must needs giue me leaue to be the leader because so it hath pleased God, his Hol. and his Maiestie to accompt me; and not

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And as for seruants and followers in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland which yow say he shal fynd more by following another course rathet then this I do, God send vs come to the trial, and happily arriue there, and then shal you see by the effect, what lacke of frends I shal there haue, vvhere I thinke verily to haue yow my frend also, vvhich shalbe best for yow, and very grateful vnto me, howsoeuer vnaduisedly yow haue here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled your selfe in my aduersaryes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken matters.</q>

            <p>VVe do pretermit of purpose many other letters vvhich might be cyted, for that they would be ouerlong, as namely one vnder the Cardinals owne hand wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Gouernour of Flaunders 30. of Feb. 1592. about this faction by occasion of imprisonment of Th.

            <p>Thus began M.

            <p>But to go forward in our narration, the Fathers hauing receyued this gouernmÄt, imployed their endeauours to make the schollers fit for the mission of England, and so many prooued. But finding a diuision made in the nation and a faction raysed vp both against them and D.

            <p>These inconueniences were easylie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, but not so easily remedied, especially the Rectors being strÄgers for many yeares, that could not so wel looke into the true causes of disorders that ensued. And albeit
<pb facs="tcp:176260:63"/> they suspected them yet could they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue them. And as alwayes Sathan see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to cloke his attÄpts with some shew of piety, so heere such as ment to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, and to styrre sedition, pretended diuers zealous causes of their discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: some, that the Colledg and hospital of our nation was in strangers hands: some, that many of the schollers entred into the Society, and were drawne therunto, as these men would imagine: some other, that the orders of the house were rather for children then for men, especially for graduates of English vniuersityes, vvhen they came ouer.

            <p>Now then to runne breefly ouer some cheefe poynts of this scandalous tumultua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the beginning of the yeare 1595. wherof there is extant (besides the former visitation of Card. Sega contayning 40, chapters, and a multitude of particular

            <p>The good Cardinal being dead, great care was had presently for aduauncing the B. of Cassano into his place as no doubt it is thought that he should easily haue byn in tyme, if this ouermuch hasting of his frends had not hindred. But those that would needs haue aduaunced him prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously against the Cardinal while he was lyuing, as in the former chapter yow haue hard) had not patience to expect any tyme now when he was dead, but as though the matter had byn sure now and due and presently to followe, they caused first his nephew to buy all the dead Cardinals habit and apparel, as this narration she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth which being hard of in the citty and
<pb facs="tcp:176260:65"/> the tumultuation of these schollers follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing presently to the same effect did giue great suspition and mislike also to many.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The first petition that vvas made for the B.</note>First then it was agreed vpon among these pretenders, that wheras Cardinal Allen had authority to giue facultyes to all priests that should go into EnglÄd (though he were not Protector) his authority should be demaunded in particular for the Bishop, as a man that knew better the particuler merits and abilityes of English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for geuing them facultyes then could the Protector Cardinal Caietan being a stranger, and it was so wrought that the Protector himselfe should be entreated to demaund this grace of his Hol. for the B. as he did most willingly and effectually (as he was a man of a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t noble and royal nature) but his Hol. foreseing by his great wisdome what might be pretÄded hereby refused to giue the said faculties to the B. and gaue them to the said Protector, which made the actors of this designmÄt to fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to suspition and diffidence with the said Protector.</p>
            <p>And here vpon hauing taken cÅsulation a new (for now was M. Thomas Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton come to towne, and ioyning with D. Hugh Griffin the Bishops nepew and some others of this part, made the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176260:65"/> abroad and two or three priests of the Colledge ioyned with him drew many schollers after on the other side) their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond resolution was to make a very fayre Memorial to F. <hi>Claudius Aquauiua General</hi> of the Society that he would persuade <hi>Cardinal Caetan</hi> to obtayne this matter for the B. of the Pope praysing infinitely the Societyes good gouernmÄt ouer them,<note place="margin">The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial for the B to F.

This memorial did Cardinal Sega afterward much wonder at, when he saw how many cÅtrary Memorials to this they gaue vp against the Society in all the points that heere they so highly comÄded. And the cause was, for that the General talking with the Cardinal &amp; finding that the Pope was resolute in this poynt, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Schollers at their repayre vnto him for answere to be quiet and attend to their studyes, and to desist from these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, vntil eyther his Hol. should of himselfe thinke what was conuenient to be done for aduauncing some man of our nation, or that the matter might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by other men of higher calling thÄ

Louing F. the cause of these sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful styrres I find to be these: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <q>First that the schollers were permitted by the Rector at the beginning to deale in publike affayres, as namely for a Cardinal, for facultyes, and the like. VVherin being persuaded now that the Society is of a contrary mynd they haue conceaued indignation and auersion, as though the fathers were enemyes to them, their cause, and countrey, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is cunningly brought in before the Rector suspected it, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <q>Secondly some of the same faction heere abroad in Rome were put in hope to haue gotten the fingering of the Colledge rents vnder the name of a cÅgregation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was made to the heads of offices and roomes to their contentment; and many priuiledges to the schollers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <q>Thirdly there is one here vehemently suspected for a false brother sent hither of purpose (out of England.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly I fynd such here, as I expelled out of Rhemes for their misdemeanour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly I find very many receyued at all aduentures. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly during these troublesome broyles, where
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176260:71"/> neyther study of learning nor exercise of vertue keepeth them occupied, no maruel if some yong men would willingly looke backe to the world, and take any occasion to go away with the rest. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenthly I fynd their heads ful of false bruits and differÄces betwene Iesuits and priests in England, yea the selfe same faction that is at Bruxels to be heere also against the Spaniards, &amp; such as take that way. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly these are gone so farre and haue committed so many out rages, as they dispayre to go backe, and the multitude being sworne togeather maketh them more bold.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>These causes &amp; some other I fynd, &amp; haue shewed to his Hol. these dayes in more ample sort, then now I can wryte, besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his Hol. to haue pitty vpon the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; their madnesse,<note place="margin">D.

And for the Fathers I told his Hol. the many respects wherby we are most bound to the Society, and could not breake vvith them without wonderful shame and vndoing of Gods cause in our countrey. And concerning the secÅd which is our nation, I declared to his Holines that
<pb facs="tcp:176260:72"/> against these few factious heads the whole colledge at Doway, the colledges in Spayne and S. Omers, the priests in England and generally all our nation Catholike (a few only excepted, by whose il councel these youthes were deceaued) stood vnited with the fathers, and with order and discipline against these factions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This was the effect of my speech to his Hol. who answered much to my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment willing me to attend to the remedies and to consult with the Cardinal prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and his Hol. would allow of that wee should conclude. So vpon thursday last the Cardinal F. General F. Tyrius the Rector and my selfe haue agreed vpon the remedyes, expecting his Hol. authority for the execution of the same. Thus it standeth, and within a few dayes we hope for an end.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus wrote that good man, but his hope had not effect for that tyme, through the exceeding obstinaty of the mutyned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but rather matters went worse and worse, in so much that F.

            <p>This passed at that tyme, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all that Sommer following, and when in September they were to depart towards England I meane the cheef of those that had byn troublesome in the Colledge they went to take their leaue of his Hol. and one of them made, a very pithy (though breefe) speech to his Hol. about this matter, promising quietnes and all obedience for the tyme to come.<note place="margin">The Popes speech the 3. of Sept. 1597.</note> By which occasion the Pope geuing them first a vehement repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension for troubles past, exhorted &amp; cÅ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them there with like instÄce to be at peace, for the tyme to come both among themselues and namely with the fathers of the Society.<note place="margin">The letter of M.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:176260:77"/> curtesyes of the Fathers there, namely F. Holt, by commendations of F. P. letters.</p>
            <p>Thus the matter passed then, and albeit afterward though new disorders commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some of the former troublesome left in Rome, some restraynt and punishment was layd vpÅ them, which F. P. could not altogeather let &amp; hinder, for that by their owne faults it was made publike, yet did he seeke to moderate things, all that he could, as the Cardinal. &amp; officers by whose hands matters did passe, haue testified. and his Hol. himselfe wel knoweth.

            <p>And when afterward D. Barret wrote wel and gaue frendly relation of some of their behauiours in Doway, that were sent away from Rome F.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:176260:78"/> diuers letters both of Cardinal Caetan him selfe while he liued, and Cardinal Farne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius that succeeded him in the Protection of England, and of Cardinal Burghesius ioyned with them in commission for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our countrey, all which letters in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the said priests and schollers F.

            <p>INto noe one matter more vnwillingly do we enter, then into this of the Castle of VVisbich, which hath byn held hitherto by Catholikes in greate reuerence, as an house of Saynts, and sacred seruants of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God confessors and martyrs for these many yeares. Yet for that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy of mankynd spareth not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euery where, and the holier the house, the sooner is his hand, and foote therin (as for Monasteries &amp; Eremitages do testifie <hi>Cassianus Palladius,</hi> and other wryters, and for prisons of confessors and martyrs it is euident by <hi>S.

That when that Castle was in greate peace and rest, the Iesuits desyring to haue dominion ouer priests, procured, presently after the death of Cardinal Allen, and Card.

VVhich being done, by the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the maior part of the company, and certayne rules of orderly liuing for a shew being prescribed (albeit he for dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion refused it) yet at length by commÄd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his superior, he tooke it vpÅ him, wherat others repyning there beganne a diuision and separation among them, wherof many disorders and incÅueniences succeeded, which these our discontented brethren (if we may beleeue these libels to haue comen from them &amp; that they would

            <p>This then is the true summe of all that which hath passed in the Castle of Wisbich for these 6. or 7. yeares since these people began to breake the peace, and to rayse tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults there. And now it would remayne, that we should go about to proue all these particulars, not only by the present relatiÅ sent vs from thÄce, testified by diuers graue men that haue seene the matters passe by their owne eyes as we haue said, but by other more ancient letters and wrytings also, wherof we haue good store, that came forth as the thinges themselues fel out.

               <q>In this narration they say, that after the death of the most reuerend L. B. of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne, L. Abbot of VVestminster, and the rest of old Fathers, there liued in VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bich Castle more then 33. prisoners, wherof two were lay men, the rest priests religious and secular in great quietnes, peace &amp; loue with great edification to others, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual profit to themselues good exercise of learning was practised, as disputing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersyes and cases of conscience, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in scriptures and exhortation, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying also of the tongues both Hebrue and Greeke, but who was the Author and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motor of all these exercises but F.

Edmund and were directed by him, not any of those that since haue prooued factious; For although some few of them in the beginning came to those exercises, yet were they soone weary of wel doing, and the burthen of all did
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:176260:86"/> ly vpon 6. or 7. special persons, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for his vertues honored F. Edmund.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto are the words of the said rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this that followeth we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, taking the cheefe poynts only for auoyding prolixity. They say then that all the company in that tyme of peace, hauing no special superiors, referred themselues &amp; their affayres to the directiÅ of three men, who were F. Edmund, M. Metham, and M. Bluet, which last was in very good tune all the tyme that M. Metham lyued, for the great respect he bare vnto him, &amp; that he shewed euer a special dislike of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of M. Bagshaw, for the vnquiet spirit he saw to be in him, and continual quarrels he had with euery man being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed also of the great garboyles he had raysed vp as wel in two colledges of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, where he had liued,<note place="margin">Baliol. col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterhal.</note> as also in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Colledge, from whence he had byn expulsed by the Protector <hi>Card. BoncÅpagno</hi> his owne hands. And that M. Metham had so great dislike of the mans restles, turbulÄt nature, as he said he had a wyndmil in his head, and was once determyned to haue cÅ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented and shamed him before the whole company, if F. Edmund by his intercession had not letted it, yet that others (and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely M. Stranguige) seing no remedy how
<pb facs="tcp:176260:87"/> to represse him by authority, procured against the opinion of many other, that he should be preferred to be one of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said cheefe dealers, therby eyther to gaine or quiet him. But he was deceaued, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he proued worse, and was so ful of braules with all men, as his ghostly Father being a quiet man was forced to giue him ouer. And at that tyme M. Bluet &amp; he were greatly out; he reporting euery where in corners most contumeliously of M. Bluets hasty rude and fiery nature, and M. Bluet protesting that he would <hi>trounse</hi> him (for so were his woords) and this falling out grew to such excesse one day in a good priests chamber, that had byn long sicke, &amp; liueth yet to testifie the same, that good F. Edmund was forced to fal vpÅ his knees, &amp; with much intreaty made thÄ frÄds againe, but afterward M. Bluet lacking his old stay of M. Methams good counsel and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into many impatient words and deeds dayly by age and wearisomnesse of so long imprisonment,<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of frÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene M. Bag. and M. Bluet.</note> in so much as he would not only reuile and threaten men, but strike &amp; beat them also, as occasion was offered. M. Bagsh. tooke this occasion to gaine the old man by flattering him exceedingly &amp; excusing and defending his excesses, which good F. Edmund not being able to do in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:176260:87"/> conscience nor thinking it expedient for edificatiÅ of the house (though yet he bare also much) M. Bagsh. by these meanes grew in by litle and litle with M. Bluet, &amp; set him quite out with F. Edmund which was the very beginning and foundation of all our spiritual miseryes and dissentions, for so much as hence forward F. Edmunds godly exhortations were contemned by them and theirs, yea M. Bagsh. would not only deryde them, but go about also to picke out matter of heresy against them. And consequently, the more he preached order and discipline and the like, the worse some men were, thinking it a comendation not to follow Iesuites doctrine or obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅs, which they went about by all meanes possible to bring in contempt.</p>
            <p>This then beeing the cÅdition and state of that company it is easy to consider, what great disorders would presently ensue in life and conuersation, which yet is seene more particularly by a common letter of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort of priests, subscribed by eighteene hands, and wrytten in Ianuary in the yeare 1595. to F. VValley alias Garnet Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of the Iesuits in EnglÄd, wherin they request his helpe and counsel (hauing no lawful Superiour at that tyme of their owne, to whome for that purpose they
<pb facs="tcp:176260:88"/> might make recourse) how they might best auoyd the greate inconueniences that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by this disorderly lyfe brought in by a few, and preuent the great scandal that was like to fal vpÅ the whole Catholike cause, by their publike discredit, yf spedy remedy were not taken, for that the heretikes eyes were bent vpon them, and would not lese their aduantage therin, if matters passed forward as they did.</p>
            <p>And for more perspicuityes sake, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all their disorders to ten principal members, disguising notwithstanding their speech by general tearmes, least it might fal into the enimyes hands; &amp; touching no man in particular. The first wherof was, in these woords:<note place="margin">Ten heads of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in VVi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbich brought in by seditiÅ.</note>
               <hi>Otium &amp; languor, atque Ã  bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis studijs, &amp; virtutum exercitijs magna cessatio:</hi> Idlenes and lasynes, &amp; a great ceasing from good study and exercise of vertue.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:176260:88"/> and so passed they forward vnto ten heads of different disorders, or euident suspitions and perils therof, which for breuities sake we omit.</p>
            <p>Now then matters standing in this case, we aske euery good and indifferent man, desyrous to saue his soule and to be out of these broyles, what he should do in this case, if he had byn in it. For as for Superior there was none to make recourse vnto but heretikes, that would laughe at it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So as when M. VVigges an auncient master of art, and priest,<note place="margin">This is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the former vvryten re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation frÅ VVisbich this yeare 1601.</note> spoke but one word in misliking of certayne ouer hard speaches and dealings of M. Bluet, towards M. Ithel another priest, he was beaten twise by the said M. Bluets fist, as all can testifie that were then present: so saith the relation.</p>
            <p>The only way then which those good men could thinke of for auoyding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences a foresaid was to make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne rules of honest and ciuil conuersatiÅ among themselues with some head or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector for better obseruing therof which
<pb facs="tcp:176260:89"/> they desyred might be the forsaid F. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund; and so with all their voyces agreing togeather, they elected him, but he vtterly refusing the same, they made recourse vnto his Superior by a comon letter in latyn, subscribed with all their hands, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth thus:<note place="margin">The letter of 18. priests to F.

            <p>This and much more they wryte in that letter alleadging many reasons of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and how that F.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:90"/> aboue the rest, but only to direct them, not knowing or suspecting at that tyme (as after he protested by letters to D.

Edm. for that he dependeth perhaps of a forrayne Superior, that is, of his General in Rome, as he doth also afterward draw to like daunger or calumniation of forraine Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:176260:91"/> the authority of the Archepriest comming from his Hol. and therfore he saith here immediatly after the former words: <hi>I wil suppose, we might safely admit such forraine authority, I wil not cast any daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or difficulty in sending or resending letters I wil not accuse any of our selues to haue Italiana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humors and idle heads, &amp;c.</hi> Do yow see heere that he would bring men within the compasse of the statute of <hi>Premunire</hi> or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for admitting a few rules made by themselues for more orderly conuersation? wherof I see no other reason or pretÄce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be that which we haue now said; for that F. Edm. the director hath a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in Rome: who would beleeue that paission could carry men to such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes.</p>
            <p>But yet it is more wonderful to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his cauilling at the very lawes and rules themselues first in general and then in particular, wherby yow may see his humour who talketh so much of Italiana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humors he hauing byn also himselfe in Italy &amp; dismissed thÄce as yow haue hard for his ouer troublesome English humors.</p>
            <p>Thus he wryteth of the rules in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.<note place="margin">D. B. His egredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations at the rules.</note>
               <hi>The lawes of this common welth to which euery free denizen at his infranchising must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, before witnes, do not only in themselues
<pb facs="tcp:176260:92"/> want the qualityes of good lawes, which ought to be honest, iust, possible, according to the nature and custome of the countrey, fit for the tyme, and place, &amp;c. But are ful of absurdityes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, the causes of them are most wicked, idle surmises, and vncharitable, suspitions, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this in general which yet is spoken without all groÅ«d for in the rules there is no mention of any such matter, but are most modestly and charitably wrytten, nor can he (comming to the particular) find any least ground, wherby to giue colour to these calumniations, as yow shal heare by his owne words: For thus it followeth in him immediatly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In particular</hi> (sayth he) <hi>after a preface of fayre general tearmes vsual to the very worst deuises that euer haue bin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And to the best also.</note>
               <hi>there is in the first and second lawes a stopping of reprehentions, contradictions and iudgments concerning this new platforme. And in the second law the maker could no longer hold, but to ease his mynd and shew his greefe and descrie his end, must needs promulgate, that euery one besides him which should say grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A very heynous offence for priests to sit at table as they come.</note>
               <hi>and by that title sit highest, should sit promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, a thing not practised in any orderly place in the world, a disgrace to all degrees of learning, And fit for Anabaptists, a seditious mutiny and confusion against the seueral orders of the church, a contempt of Reuerend age, and therfore to be left
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:176260:92"/> to the reuiued Arrians, whose saying that is,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra secta nÅ curat canos: <hi>a bayte to draw infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior men by hope of a shew of eminency now and then, which otherwise by their place and perhaps desert should comonly be obscure, and therfore a necessary cause of diuision against those which would not consent to such absurd inouations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus and much more he reueleth vpon this poynt. And consider we pray yow the mans, talent in picking quarrels, and setting debate, in that he can find so greate inconueniences absurdities and so heynous crimes in priests siting at table as they come, which is vsed in al modest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular congregations in the world, and all this styrre to make roome to his Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which God knoweth in what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world he gate it, and how worthily; but certaine it is, as farre as we are informed, by ordinary comendation of his superiours he had it not; And this being the greatest quarrel or inconuenience that he could finde in all these rules, to wit, <hi>that priests should sit promiscuously at table as they came,</hi> yet doubting least men would laugh at it, he seeketh an other quarrel, as though it were an vnworthie thinge for men of his dignity, and his fellowes to be limited to any rule at all though neuer so willingly taken vpon thÄselues. To which
<pb facs="tcp:176260:93"/> effect he goeth forward with a supposal, saying.<note place="margin">A lofty cÅ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor fraught vvith pride and vanity.</note>
               <hi>And were there no inconuenience in these lawes, yet the indignity of them, is much to be wayed, for what can be greater then to make priests sent with more then ordinary or episcopal authority to be tyed to the pleasure of such as be not their Superiors and to be prescribed by the orders of others, who should be better occupied in ordering themselues, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lo heere vanity, pride and emulation, which are the very grounds of all these styrres. His meaning is that these orders come from the Fathers of the Society who comonly do labour euery where to bring in good orders. But in this poynt there are extant diuers letters both of F. Edm. him selfe vnto his General in Rome and to F. <hi>Oliuerius Manarreus</hi> in Flaunders, and of F. <hi>Garnet</hi> as wel to the said General as to M.

            </p>
            <p>Thus wryteth that good man &amp; much more (for his letter is large) confirming all those poynts that before we haue touched both of the outragiÅs speches of M.

            <p>
               <hi>F. Garnet</hi> also in his letter of the 8. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1595. to M. Bagshaw professeth
<pb facs="tcp:176260:94"/> that he was not the Author, nor yet counse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the former seperation in VVisbich, though if he had byn in the sense there set downe, which was nothing els but to counsel them, to liue more reclaymedly, and with lesse clamors he sayth it had byn iustifiable by more reasons of spirit &amp; good order then any man of a good spirit can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne,<note place="margin">F.

This was all I graunted, and for this I hope with equal iudges I shal not be condemned of any great fault or wickednesse.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This and much more wryteth the said Father to M. Bagshaw, which for breuity wee passe ouer, &amp; many other letters, which wee might heere recyte, and wil come to speake breefly of the peace and compositiÅ made among them by two priests assisted with the letters of F.

Edmund in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that they should by one way or other make an ende of this controuersy; the issue was, that the better part were content, so that some forme of discipline &amp; good order might be kept, whervpon all the former rules being layd a side and a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bolished, there were new made by consent of both parts, to which all subscribed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two authentical copies the one with the one side, and the other with the other, which two sides were now made one, and all revnited with great ioy and consolatiÅ:
<pb facs="tcp:176260:95"/> And that the better sort meant playnly and sincerely and from their very harts, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by a very spiritual letter of theirs wrytten to F.

               <note place="margin">The letters of the quiet part in VVisb. to F. Garn. for the peace made 8. Nou. 1595.</note>

            <p>Thus they say wherby we may see, that these mens meaning was only to haue some order and discipline. The otherside also wrote to the same effect, and especially M.

            <p>M. Mush also wrote at the same tyme a very kynd letter to F. Garnet,<note place="margin">M. Mush. and M. Dudl. to F. G. 8. Nou. 1505.</note> in his owne and M.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:96"/> And no doubt the victory had not byn gotten, vnlesse yow on the mountayne had feruently lifted vp your hands to heauen, and assisted with the charitable fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp of deuout brethren and frends;<note place="margin">Consider hovv con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary this is to that they vvryte in these later libels.</note> your owne good desyres, and our endeauors, with most zealous prayer, and clamors to God, and his triumphant saints in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of their comon feast, good newes therfore yow receyue, the blessed fruite of your blessed desyres and paynes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These were his words at that tyme, which yf they be true, then are many other things very vntrue, which appeare vnder his name in these late libels, for that they are quite contrary to these. And wheras heere in this letter, he maketh a very earnest and spiritual exhortation to peace and vnion, shewing the great and damnable daungers, that ensue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, now he seemeth to haue forgotten that, by his later doings and wrytings, in these libels, tending expresly to manifest sedition. The note wherof, and of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy herin, must needs be greuous to al his frends. M. Bag. also contradicteth himselfe notoriously in this letter, for if it be true that he wryteth a litle before of F. Edmund that he behaued himselfe so wel in making of this peace; with what
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:176260:96"/> truth or modesty can he tel all the world now in print,<note place="margin">Lib. la. pa. 20.</note>
               <hi>that Father Edmund was so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do it that he sayd he would rather cast himselfe downe from the Castle wals, and that he was so astonished by the very treaty therof, as he was mute, and besides himselfe:</hi> and this calumniation being come to the eares of those of VVisbich, they do exclame vpon it, as a most iniurious and notarious ly, as by their late wrytten relation appeareth.</p>
            <p>The same relation also doth vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the false accusations, layd vpon M. Archer a venerable priest (whome since they haue caused to be put into the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tower of Londen) as though he should haue said that <hi>Lupanaria Roma approbantur, &amp;c.</hi> and other such fond and absurd propositions, which they haue fayned against him and set downe in their latyn booke which (as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) he neuer said, but this rather that at a certayne tyme hearing M. Norden say that toleration could not be without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, vsed this argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> to confute him <hi>ergo Lupanaria Romae appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur, quia tollerantur.</hi> VVhich instance, the other being not able to answere, tooke an occasion of large calumniation, set on and egged by M. Bagsh against the said priest. And for that F. Edm. would haue ended
<pb facs="tcp:176260:97"/> the matter by explicating the priests mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, both doctors tooke also against him, as they would haue wryten whole bookes and treateses therof, had not God taken vp the controuersy, by cutting of M. Norden strangely; as before hath bin said.</p>
            <p>But now there remayneth only to say a word or two how this peace being once so solemnly made was broken againe. The cause I haue noted before for that they would be vnder no rule: and the present relation of VVisbich,<note place="margin">The true cause of the breach in VVisb. after the peace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> seteth it downe in these words: <hi>D. Norden</hi> (say they) <hi>hauing, bin mulcted oftentymes by force of the rules, for his fowle tonge, and lastly desiring to see the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Copye which was in the hands of the better part: when he had got them into his fingers (not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withstanding he had promised vpon his word to restore them faithfully) he ranne away with them to D. Bagshawes chamber, and so after they could neuer be put in vre againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of R. Fisher vpÅ his oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nevv breach in VVisb.</note>This reporteth that relation, but Rob.

That when M. Bagsh. and his part, were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:176260:97"/> weary of the said new rules, they fayned an occasion of doubt whether M. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae Pound his name, were in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or noe, which being shewed, M. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den snatched the same,<note place="margin">Se the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of R. Fish. 12.

Mush and M. Dudley that they should burne or deface the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, &amp;c. And then these rules being cast aside, discord began to grow daylie more and more, and I both saw and hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, vnworthy of their calling. But those of the part of M. Bagshaw did seeme to beare themselues much more insolently, both in words &amp; deeds, then the other side.</p>
            <p>Thus he sayeth with a long narration of particularityes, which I omit, or rather remit vnto our other Apologie. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points are that he saw such disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behauiour in that side, which he fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and conuersed with all, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to doubt what to say or thinke of their cause. For he saw them so familiar and in credit with the Ialour and his wife, such banqueting, such scoffing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiue speech against the other side (with whome they would not suffer him to treat at all) as he was litle edified therby, and
<pb facs="tcp:176260:98"/> began greatly to doubt. And of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side he saith, that by their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and behauiour, they seemed much more humble, quiet, deuout, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified then the rest. And further he saith that once among other tymes, he walking in the court with some of both sides to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geather, he saw M. Norden speake twise or thrise in the eare of M. Christopher Southworth (a graue priest &amp; knights sÅne) wherwith he seemed to be somwhat moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but had noe remedy, because no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man hard it; but afterward M. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den told both Fisher and others in the presence of D. Bagsh that he had called him knaue, and arrant knaue in his eare wherat they laughed merily. which is not discrepant from the complaynt of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other priest, wrytten from VVisbich the same yeare, who testifieth that the same Reuerend and worshipful priest was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led knaue,<note place="margin">M. I. G. the 14. Iuly. 1598.</note> &amp; Montebanck, by one of the said two Doctors in the presence of two priests come from abroad, for that he had giuen good and spiritual councel which was deryded. And the like liuery of knaue was giuen to an other priest by one of the Doctors followers, as an ordinary liuery vsed to be giuen by them.</p>
            <p>Thus reporteth Fisher in his answere
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176260:98"/> ministred to him in these words: <hi>Quid sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiret in conscientia &amp; coram Deo &amp; sub iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mÄto iam praestito de vtriusque partis hominibus &amp; rebus.</hi> VVhat he thought in conscience and before God and vnder his oath already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the men and affaires of both sides in VVisbich, and after confirmed all with these woords: <hi>Ego R. Fish. ita dico, iuro &amp; ratifico.</hi> And all this is confirmed againe by the subscription of his Hol. offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier. <hi>Ego Acharitius squarsionius, &amp;c.</hi> VVhich we do ad for more credit of the matter, &amp; for that we are to cyte diuers things out of this confession of Fisher in the chapters following. This last relation also of VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bich hath one thing touching the good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of those of the Doct. side, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be discerned their disposition, and this is: that when M Mush came to make the peace, he being led about saith the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to see the orders of this lesser nÅ«ber, was shewed 6. or 7. butteries for 13. persons they not suffering the 20. to haue any. And further the party that directed him, after he had shewed him all these, he brought him to a chimney where also there was good ale, and said here is an other buttery, nay said M. Mush there is the diuel, wherof that place was called afterwards me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ily by some; the diuel in a corner.</p>

And this is the true state of the question. Let vs declare breefly the way and path how they came into this pit.</p>
            <p>VVe haue vnderstood by Cardinal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens letters before mentioned, wryttÄ vnto M.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:176260:106"/> the Carthusians, and they two with some few other, determyned to make a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne new Hierarchy of their owne, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it an Association of Clergy-men with two Superiors as it were Archbishops the one for the South and the other for the North with certaine rules and deuises im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be obserued in England, whiles tymes and matters do remayne as they doe.

            <p>But it shalbe better perhaps that we set downe this in the very words of six of our reuerend brethren priests Assistens of our most Reuerend Archpriest, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required these moneths past by the <hi>Nuntius Apostolicus</hi> in Flanders to wryt vnto him the true causes of these stirs (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the late appellation from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest) with their iudgements &amp; opinions therof, as also of the remedy, they ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered him with great sincerity and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, first shewing the greefe they had in

            <p>Thus farre do relate the whole matter, these R. Brethren of ours.

So as we see, that the selfe same matters, or the very like comming from lawful Superiours and by orderly meanes, are reiected, and excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against, but coming neuer so disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly from their owne inuentions and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate diuises are magnified and imbraced; And this can worke, selfe-wil and loue of our selues.</p>
            <p>Touching the detestable memorial heere mentioned drawne out and published against the Fathers of the Society,<note place="margin">About the memor. brought ouer by Fish. 1597.</note> at the very same tyme, when this association was in making, therby to discredit the said Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, against whome diuers good priests did suspect this Association in part to be deuised, it began thus: <hi>Breuis declaratio miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi status Catholicorum in Anglia.</hi> A breefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the miserable state of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in EnglÄd. And thÄ he putteth downe 11. sorts of calamityes and miseryes which Catholikes suffer, all at the Iesuits hands.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:109"/> then heretikes themselues.</hi> And for that we haue seene the former Assertion vnder M. Bag. owne hand giuen to M.

Sherwyn, M.D. Haddocke, M. Rish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, M. D. Barret and others in tymes past. And for the present, there are very many both vniuersity men and graduats of both vniuersityes in all the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and are greatly made of by the Fathers, if their vertue answere to their degree. But if any man should be so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, as this man sheweth himselfe in his former wryting, accusing men of Arrianisme Donatisme and other heresyes, for that they giue them not alwayes the higher end of the table (especially among priests, and diuers that are his auncients) no maruayle if such graduats be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to Iesuits, that are men of otder.</p>
            <p>And this might be sufficient for this whole matter which now we haue in hÄd, but only thar we thinke good to ad a litle more about this memorial of Rob.

            <p>Thus much wrote D.

            <p>This being determined to make a subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, we vnderstÄd that his Hol. tooke tyme to consulte for some monethes with the congregation of Cardinals of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, what mÄner of gouernmÄt it should be for the tyme present, and by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it might be best instituted without any
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:176260:115"/> great innouation of matters in England, so as the state should not be exasperated ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by against the Catholikes, in which tyme also he willed informacion to be procured out of England of the fittest men for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as it was done, and diuers letters are extant of their opinion therin, though these vnquiet perhaps were not demanded in particuler, neyther was it needful they being so smal a parte of the English Cleargie.</p>
            <p>In Rome also, the opinions were asked by the Protector of the principal Inglish that resided there and could best informe, as namely F. Persons, that had often aduise from thence, F. Baldwyn lately come from England. M. Doctor Haddock, M. Martyn Aray, M. Iames Standish, and others that had labored in the English Vineyard, as also M. Thomas Allen, nephew to the late Card. and diuers els, who concurring with the opinion of letters comming out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as also with diuers other principal men that wrote therof from Spayne, FlaÅ«<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and other places both of the necessitie of some subordination to be made and for the fitnes, and sufficiencie of M. Blak wels person, his Hol. resolued according to their opinions, and informations in these two poyntes, to wit, to appoynt a gouernment,
<pb facs="tcp:176260:116"/> &amp; that this man should be the gouernour, though for the third about the kynd or manner of gouernment,<note place="margin">VVhy his Hol. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed no Bishoppes.</note> he iudged not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the present to appoynt any other but an Archpriest (an ancient digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the church of Christ) least if he should haue begunne with Bishops he doubted very probably, that it would haue caused some great motion in England, for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wherof he resolued also for this first tyme not to write himselfe any Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal letters, but to commit rather the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the matter by special order to the Protector to be done in his name.</p>
            <p>Loe heere then the groundes of this his Hol. resolution so farre as we are informed by thÄ that were priuie thervnto, &amp; by this are ouerthrowne all those cauillations, &amp; suspicious coniectures which our discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented brethren in their late bookes haue set foorth about this meaning aswel of his Hol. and the Protector, as of those also that gaue informations, for procuring of this authority, sinistrously interpreting the one, and the other. For first we see heere that the necessitie of our diuisions, &amp; emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous proceedings one against an other did enforce, both Catholikes to desyre some subordination amongst priests, and his Hol. to yeild thervnto.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:176260:116"/>
            <p>For so long as our Cleargie proceded in the spirite of humilitie, obedience, peace, and vnitie, there was no need of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, for that euery one was a rule, and lawe to himselfe:<note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> but <hi>crescente numero discipulorum factum est murmur Graecorum aduersus Hebraeos, &amp;c.</hi> when the multitude of our priests en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and the former spirite in many of them decreased, there beganne presently murmuration, and emulation against the Fathtrs of the Society, as though they only did hinder vs, who indeed were and are the men that do principally helpe vs both in word and lyfe, and so long as we were content to learne: but some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the Seminaries (where they had byn vnder the Iesuits) with lesse or worse spirite then were to be wished,<note place="margin">Beginning of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ against Iesuites in England.</note> drewe others to emulate them, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had obeyed, for auoyding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it seemed in all good mens opinions (and the Iesuites aboue the rest) that the only or chief remedy would be to haue this subordination of <hi>secular Priests</hi> among themselues, wherby the other might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne foorth of all occasion of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thus much for his Hol. motiue to institute this Hierarchie or subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But for the manner of procuremÄt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

<pb facs="tcp:176260:118"/> for their procuring the subordination seing heere it is freely confessed that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by Priests themselues with the consent and priuitie of the more parte of all the Cleargie,<note place="margin">See the letter of 6. ancient priests the 13 of Sept. 1597.</note> of which priests (the most ancient, and graue among all the rest) there are diuers letters yet extant demaunding this poynt.</p>
            <p>And moreouer we are most certaynly informed, that wheras euery where almost these libels do charge F.

            <p>And besydes all this we vnderstand that he procured Card.

            <p>VVel this then being resolued by his Hol. that he would haue an Archpriest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted in England whÅ all the rest should obey, he gaue commissiÅ to the said Card. protector,<note place="margin">The Card.

            <p>From which doctryne and spirite of ancient Fathers, our men running vpon passion, we may see whether they runne.</p>
            <p>And all this now is about the first kynd of formal disobediÄce, wherin there must be some actual contÄpte with reflexiÅ, which is as out of CaetÄ yow haue heard an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ not to obey, &amp; would to God this also were not to opÄly seene in this fact of our

            <p>But now besydes this there is an other kynd of material disobedience, when a man leaueth to do that which is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not with intention, or reflexion,<note place="margin">The secÅd kind of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vvith is material &amp; not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</note> that he wil not obey or doth contemne this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, but only that he doth eyther omit that which was commanded, or do some other thing contrarie therunto, and in this kynd is it to be presumed, that the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>Adam Acan Saul,</hi> and others were, wherby we see, and all deuines do hold that this kynd of disobedience also may be a heynous and mortal sinne, according to the qualitie of the matter and meaning of the <hi>Superior,</hi> that is to say, as all schoole men do note, the greater the <hi>Superior</hi> is whose precept is pretermitted (though not <hi>resisted or impugned</hi>) and the more important the matter is wherin this pretermissiÅ hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, and the more earnest,<note place="margin">D.

               <hi>HOVV AFTER THE</hi> first cÅtradiction made by our Brethren against his Holines ordinance about the Archpriest by the Protectors letters, they vvent forvvard, and sent a couple to Rome, and vvhat happened to them there: and hovv his Hol. confirmed the foresaid ordinance and Protectors let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vvith a nevv Breue. <hi>CAP.

            </head>
            <p>WE haue shewed in the former Chapter with how great singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and litle reason our discÅtented bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, being so few, and such as they were opposed themselues at the beginninge to the first institutiÅ of this Hierarchie, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Hol. and against the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our English Cleargy besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues admitting the same. Now it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to consider with what resolution &amp; obstinacy they haue prosecuted this their deuision, notwithstanding all the meanes vsed to diuert them from it, and quiet thÄ both by Superiors commandements and frends persuation. And first of all about this point is to be noted, that if our said bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren had meant plainly and sincerly (as
<pb facs="tcp:176260:136"/> often they do professe in the two first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of their English booke intituled <hi>Copies of discoursss, &amp;c.</hi> and in their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the Doctors of Paris they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch the same) to wit, that their scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was only whether this matter came frÅ his Hol. or noe? and whether Cardinal Caetan the Protector abusing the Popes name had appoynted it of himselfe,<note place="margin">A false pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence.</note> and that they differed only to concurre with the rest of their brethren, vntil they might be a certayned of this poynr. If this (I say) had bin so, and not only a cloke or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to couer their designmÄt of making sedition, it had bin a very easy matter to cleare the doubt by many wayes, yea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sending any to Rome, for that so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike an act as this vnder a Cardinals let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents might haue easily bin enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of without messengers; &amp; one letter of their owne eyther to his Hol. himselfe or to Cardinal. Aldobrandino his nephew or any aquaintance of theirs that was in Rome might soone haue procured them a certificate of this matter if they had byn desirous to haue knowne the truth. Yea further no man was there if the contrary part it selfe, which in his behalfe would not haue endeauored to ptocure them satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:176260:136"/>
            <p>But when it was seene and vnderstood that they rested not heere, but intended a further diuision, and that by geuing out, that they would send mÄ to Rome to cÅtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and ouerthrow the whole, they sought to hould men in suspence from obeying their Superior, and to terrifie others, least it might be recalled that now they admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; that they sought by all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to cal in question and discredit, both the Cardinal his letters, authority, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yea the fact of the Pope himselfe, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he could not do it without thÄ, except he violated the Church Canons. And lastly that this authority was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne or forraine iurisdiction &amp; cÅsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the admission therof subiect to the law of <hi>Premunire.</hi> VVhen these things (I say) and such like were hard of tending to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest disobedience diuision and sedition, thÄ did men of iudgemÄt see and discouer, that the former pretÄce of informing them selues of this Hol. wil, was but a maske to couer their further intentions, as since hath appeared,<note place="margin">M.

            <p>VVherfore his Hol. being at that tyme in <hi>Ferrara</hi> and aduertissed from his <hi>Nuntij</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
<pb facs="tcp:176260:137"/> in FrÄce as FlÄders, as also by diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principal English both in Engl. &amp; the low coÅ«tryes of these attÄpts and intents of these troublesome people, and considering what had passed a little before in Rome, the obstinacy they had shewed in their styrres there, and seeing further many let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters comming daylie to the Protector; of this matter; he was not a little moued therat, and calling to him one day <hi>F. Bellarminus</hi> (now Cardinal) asked him if he had heard any thing of this matter from Rome who denying to haue hard, his Hol wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him presently to wryte to F. Persons therof;<note place="margin">F. Bellarm. letter to F. P. about the Popes discontÄt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 17.

This letter was of the 17 of October 1598. which letter F.

But they passing by FrÄce met not with it nor with the Pope at <hi>Ferrara</hi> at least wise so as they might haue audiÄce of him, or he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:176260:137"/> know of their beeing there, but presently at their cÅming to Rome, which was the 11. of December as appeareth by F. Persons letter to M.

Decemb. 1598.</note> notwithstanding the malitious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaryes they make vpon it) the same F. imparted with them all that had passed, persuading thÄ by all means to desist from their enterprise in contradicting his Hol. ordination, assuring them for other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters touching personal satisfaction; eyther in respect of the Archpriest or Fathers of the Society, they should haue it fully, if they brought with them any iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and the same offered them also the two Cardinals <hi>Caetan</hi> and <hi>Burgesius</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Viceprotector, but they presisting in their purpose to wrangle, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to misinforme diuers principal men in the citty of the affayres of England and diuisions, there, and namely the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary of the Inquisition and others who were so much scandalised by this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction as they professed,<note place="margin">The scÄdal that grevv in Rome vpon the messengers spech vvith strangers.</note> that wheras hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, they had had a good opinion of English affayres, now they begÄ to doubt of all.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:176260:138"/>
            <p>These things (I say) comming to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors eares &amp; by him related to his Hol. who now was come from Ferrara and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned with the memory of informations he receyued there from other parts, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to restraine this scÄdalous maner of proceeding and the hurts therof ensuing to the English cause, by cÅmanding these troublesome Agens to be retyred to the English Colledge there to be examined quietly and comodiously by one of his owne officers to see what they could say,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Signor Aca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritius squar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionius</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of S. Iohn La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans.</note> or what they brought with them worthy of so long a voyage, or of so much noise as they had made by the same.</p>
            <p>This then is the haynous fact which our discontented brethren since that tyme haue so much exaggerated throughout the world by clamours, and do at this present both amplifie and vrge in these their books against his Hol. the Cardinals and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally F. Persons as the author and Architect of all (for so they tearme him euery where) indeuoring to bring the enuy of that which they dare not lay openly vpon his Hol. and the Cardinals to fal vpon him, wheras not withstÄding, as presently shal be shewed, the cheefe informations against these men came from others and not any way from F. Persons but rather that he (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:176260:138"/> all their stomake and malice against him) serued them for a moderator and mittigator both of their imprisonment, examination and sentence against them, as appeareth by the particulars set downe in his former letters to M.

            <p>And first who doth not see that it is an ordinary art of all malecontents, and such as doe or deserue euil, to lay their il suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses vpon other men, and when they dare not do it vnto princes or suppreme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates themselues, they accuse common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such and such particular men, as they imagine to haue procured the same, or iudge to be against them, or mislike their doings.<note place="margin">The fashiÅ of all male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents to accuse other men for their ovvne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note> But this euery wise man seeth to be but a shift &amp; figuratiue maner of speech to accuse the said prince or magistrate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another mans person, or as the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to wound them through other mens sides, seing it should be a great blot to their wisdome and authority to gouerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by the passion of any particular mÄ, especially in this our case, his Hol. and the two Cardinal being so learned and wise would neuer haue bin brought by F.P. persuasiÅ (if he would haue persuaded thÄ) except they had seene greater ground then
<pb facs="tcp:176260:139"/> his will or words alone; and afterward when they were retyred, and his Hol. had appoynted a speciall officer to exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne them, and to bring the said examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnder their owne hands and others to be vewed by the Cardinals and his Hol. most certaine it is if these mÄ had brought with them any substantial or iust matter, for their contradiction and comming to Rome, they should haue had iustice, &amp; if not the falt should haue bin theirs and not F. Persons which had no voice eyther in the sentence giuen or vew of the said examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅs. VVherfore to cry out so much of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice done thÄ both in their imprisonmÄt &amp; the sentence giuen against them, and yet not to accuse his Hol. or the Cardinals but F. Persons only as though he and not they had done it, or that he gouerned them, is a cauillation which euery chyld can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer. And yet for better declaration of the one and the other of these points (to wit as wel for their imprisonment as that which ensued therÅ) we are enforced heere for defence both of his Hol. the Cardinal protectors and other officers much slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered therby to enlarge our selues a littel further in this place.</p>
            <p>And first concerning his Hol. intention to imprison them in <hi>Ferrara</hi> if they had
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:176260:139"/> come thither which our brethren make <hi>to be a strange and vnreasonable matter, that his Hol.</hi> (say they) <hi>should determine to put two priests in prison for comming to Rome with so greate aduenture and daunger of lyfe about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church, and this before he hard them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Copy of discorses, pag. 74. 75.</note>
               <hi>what they had to say, or saw them.</hi> This, I say, is a pore obiection, for if they came to trouble the Church of EnglÄd with neuer so much aduenture or if these things were true, which before we haue mentioned to haue byn wryten out of England against them, to wit that they went about to set diuision and to discredit both the protector and his Hol. in their subordinatiÅ appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then might he wel determine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayne them for this disobedience at their first arriual, and yet heare them also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if they had any thing to say, and this is a course vsually held in all princes courts of the world at this day.</p>
            <p>But now let vs see what other letters also there were from principal English men in Flanders and other places; out of England,<note place="margin">Principal English men vvrote to Rome against the tvvo mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers.</note> requyring iustice and some seuerity at his Hol. hands against theese priests for their audaciÅs and scÄdalous attempt to disturbe the peace of the church of England. And surely though the least part perhaps of
<pb facs="tcp:176260:140"/> those letters haue not come to our hands that were wrytten to his Hol. or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in this behalfe, yet by those that we haue seene, the sense and feeling of all good Catholikes of our natiÅ may easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in this affayre.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176260:144"/> set forth in print in one of their late libels, we know not with what reason, but only as they haue done other things to make a shew with heaping matters togeather, for that the letter proceedeth very substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, referring it selfe in all points to origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and publike testimonies. And albeit these men haue published two answeres to the same; the one of M. Bish. himselfe, the other of a censurer, calling himselfe M. I. B. yet neither of them answereth any one substantial poynt conteyned in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with satisfaction of a iudicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader, as wil appeare also by this which heere we are to set downe, offering for proofe therof eyther the publike testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes of his Hol. the two Cardinals Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, Acaritius the Popes fiscal, &amp; other parties that were actors or priuy to the cause, or els the depositiÅs of the said mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers themselues vnder their hands and oathes, or finally the witnes of the whole English Colledge and nation that know what passed in this matter, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner of proceeding then to publish things in corners by way of libels without any further ground of truth, then the wil of malice of the publisher.</p>

And as for their courteous &amp; gentle vsage in the Colledge, while they were there, and all kind of frendship and charity bestowed vpon them (excepting only their liberty restrayned by higher authority) of these and other points touched also by F.

But when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they came to the substantial points of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176260:145"/> their message &amp; commission in deed, then was it seene how poore a iorney these men had taken, &amp; how smal substance they had, for that which they had takÄ in hand. And albeit M Bishop in his answere to F.P. letter sticked not to auouch in the word of a priest that there was little asked them about the substantial points of their affaire,<note place="margin">Bad shifts.</note> yet is his owne deposition and his followes extant vnder their owne hands to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, wherof we haue seene an authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal copy.

               <q>The cause of our comming to Rome was this, that we might beseech most humbly and with all obedience the Sea Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that this order appoynted by Cardinal Caetan for composing controuersies in England and to make peace, not being hitherto confirmed by his Hol. as we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:176260:146"/> it is said by diuers priests and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely F. Sicclemore and others;<note place="margin">The causes of this mes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sange to Rome.</note> might be mittigated or chaunged, or some other order appoynted with it, for satisfaction of <hi>very many priests</hi> who do thinke (reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notwithstÄding due honor to the Sea Apostolike) that by this way appoynted only the strife begon cannot so wel be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Quam plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotis.</note> &amp;c. but yet if it should please his Hol. to confirme this order already appoynted by his authority, and to admit no other, then are these priests cÅtent to yeild all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, &amp;c. And as for the Superior ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted; I spoke with the Archp. before I came forth, and desired him not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me, if I went to Rome about this matter, and he gaue me leaue to goe &amp; to deale for the chaunge therof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he said, which how true or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or coherent it is to that which since they haue said, done, and set forth in their bookes, I wil leaue to the reader to iudge, only noting out certayne poynts to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. And first to begin with the very last our Archp. denieth that he gaue him licence for that he saw no iust cause; but only that he would not forbid him to go to Rome, which argueth also that he held no heretical proposition, <hi>that it was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to appeale from him to his Hol.</hi> as these men
<pb facs="tcp:176260:147"/> haue talked abroade. Secondly the same is much confirmed by the answere of M. Bishop this mans compartner in these words: <hi>Bis visitaui ArchipresbyterÅ« solus, &amp;c. I visited twise the Archpriest alone and tould him of my comming to Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exam. G. Bish. 10. Ian. 1599.</note>
               <hi>and he asked me why? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to informe the Protector and to seeke a moderation of his authority. He persuaded me the contrary, but not prohibited me.</hi> Now whether it be probable that the Archpriest would giue licence to the one of these messengers and not to the other, is not hard to gesse nay the matter is clere by an expresse let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written by the Archpriest the 17. of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust 1598. vnto the two messengers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The letter begvnneth thus. <hi>Rationem positam iteneris vestri satis acurata consideratione perlustrauimus.</hi> VVe haue examyned with diligent consideration the reasons alleaged by yow for your iourney to Rome, and we do not fynd that yow bring any thing which in my iudgement seemeth to be of moment, &amp;c. Thus he saith wherby we may perceue how he did allow of their iourney. But now let vs passe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of other poynts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Exa. Rob. Ch. 15. Ian. 1599.</note>He sayth heere that very many priests <hi>quam plures Sacerdotes</hi> were not satisfied with his Hol. order, which speech of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priests he doth explicate afterward
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176260:147"/> what number it might import in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, being pressed therevnto by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory in these words: <hi>Interrogatus, &amp;c. respondit, &amp;c. being asked what the number of Priests now in England seemed vnto him?

            </p>
            <p>But M.

               <q>The first that were called by the Archpriest to conferre his new authority with all were (as far as I know) M.

Iohn Colington, M. Cope, M. Iohnson, M.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176260:148"/> pretended, we see also that the priests could not be many; nor of great accompt, that resolued this embassage to Rome, against the Archpriest and the rest of the Cleargy.</p>
            <p>M. Bishop also being asked about his mission who sent him? with what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? why he &amp; his fellow were sent aboue the rest? and other like poynts was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled in answering, saying. <hi>Nescio quis fuerit, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exam. G. Bish. 10. IÄ. 1599.</note>
               <q>I know not who was the first author of this mission, nor know I for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne why we two were chosen for this mission aboue the rest. One of the Priests named M. Colington wrote to me, aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in VVarwickshire, in the name of other Priests, whose names I do not remÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor I haue not his letters; that I would come to London and I beleeue also he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred me in those letters that I would come to Rome, and albeit I made great difficulty, yet at last I came, and found there the laid M.

            </p>
            <p>These are his owne words, and by this we may preceaue what an authentical mission and commission this was.</p>
            <p>But yet further to say a word or two of the very cheefe poynt of their commission
<pb facs="tcp:176260:149"/> and cause of comming to Rome, yow haue hard that M. Charn. saith and sweareth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that their only comming was, <hi>to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate most hÅ«bly to the Sea Apostolike, that if the forsaid order of the Archpriests authority were not yet confirmed by his Hol. as they had hard F. Sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemore, and some other had reported, that then the same might be eyther mittigated or chaung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or some other order appoynted togeather with it,</hi> so as now our brethren seemed not to doubt of the truth or value of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letters, nor were not yet growne to be so bold as to affirme that his Hol. could not do it without their consents except he violated the <hi>CanÅs,</hi>

            <p>M. Bishop also being asked the reasons of his coming to Rome, he enlargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in six causes, VVherof the first is his priuate deuotion to that citty: The second to deale with his Holines for sending some Bishop or Bishops into England. The third if that could not be graunted, then to giue authority to some to vse the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Confirmation.</hi> The fourth to confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me their new sodality or association. The fifth to compose the stryfes in VVisbich. The sixt to put in good order the Roman
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:176260:149"/> English Colledge. In all which six causes, as yow see, there is scarse any one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth fully with the former petition or declaration of his fellow M. Charnocke, so as they hauing come so many miles togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do scarse seeme agreed in the causes of their comming. And so much of this, for that it were ouerlong to runne ouer all poynts; yet this in breefe, they affirmed both of them, that as for the Archpriest, they brought nothing lawfully proued against him eyther in learning, lyfe or mÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.<note place="margin">A breefe Summary of the cheefe poynts of these mens propositiÅ.</note> And the like they affirmed of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits. M. Bishop said he had hard his fellow Rob. say that M. Colington and himselfe had hard the Archpriest vtter an heretical propositiÅ, which was, that they could not appeale from him to Rome, but M. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke neyther affirmed nor mencioned any such matter in all his depositions, they both agreed that the money which was giuen them by collection for this iorney was aboue 300. crownes in gold, and M.<note place="margin">Exam. R. Ch 6. Ianu. 1599.</note> Charnocke addeth aboue 330. and that the cheefe gatherers were M. VVatson, M. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne &amp; M. Colington. M. Charn. said he had in comission amongst other poyntes for to procure that no bookes should be wrytten herafter by Catholikes that might exasperate the state of England, M. Bish.
<pb facs="tcp:176260:150"/> said that he liked not that comission, but rather it should be left as hitherto, to the discretion of the wryters, adding further, that in his opinion such books as before had byn wrytten had rather done good then hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">About the letters tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and scroles vvhich they brought.</note>And lastly all their papers, letters, and scroles being exhibited vnto them by the Commissarie; wherof some, and the most part of them were wrytten before the Archpriest was appoynted, demaunding only a Superiour (and these now seemed to be against them, for that now they had a Superiour) some others demaunded Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in general or a Bishop, some others asked nothing in particular but allowed only in a lyne two or three, that somthing were asked of his Hol. and these tickets or scroles were directed comonly to no body, nor had any seale, nor were not made vp in fashÅ of letters nor could not for the litle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them, being not aboue one finger or two fingers of paper; and very negligently wrytten, so as here grew a great confusion, (a strÄge maner of dealing it seemed to Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians) and hervpon also arose a great doubt what maner of commission these men had or could haue? frÅ whome? by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? for what matters? and whether all they in England would stand to all poynts

And finaly after much talke &amp; wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; wearisomnesse on all sides, no other certainty could be picked out, but that these men and their associats in England dyd only agree in cÅtradicting and pulling downe, but nothing that was probable or factible for setting vp, and so the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ended vpon the 4. of February with M.

            <p>This treatese we say did plainly lay open the whole platforme &amp; designmÄt, though these messengers in Rome would not seeme to acknowledg it, but this busy man being one of their cheefe gatherers of money for this mission, as before yow haue hard ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing set downe at length the whole plot of these new brethrens comon-wealth, concludeth the same with this earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund or petition:</p>

               <hi>VVe expect nothing</hi> (sayth he) <hi>but euen a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral destruction if speedy redresse be not had, which can be by no way, but by Bishops and gouernours, as by general consent and humble petition we all desire it vpon our knees, whose names here follow, as wel for these two we haue made choice of to be our Archbishops, Primats or cheife bishops in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority vnder his Hol. during these tymes of schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and heresyes, as also those who allow and giue consent, and do thirst after these gouernours, as wel of the cleargie as of the laity.

            </p>
            <p>By this we may see that these men had a good meaning to preferre themselues, &amp; that the iorney of the two messengers to Rome was not without hope of worthie reward, seing they were to be Primats thÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and to make as many other Bishops of their partners at their returne as should be thought conuenient, and perhaps this litle man might hope for a share also in such a common welth, And to shew how fit he was; it may be that he penned this worthie worke, as a Secretary of those Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods which these men held about their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres and new deuises. And truly it is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:176260:152"/> strange to consider with what pride &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution this yong man wryteth and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth matters of his comon welth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and contemning other men of great learning, wisdome, prety, &amp; grauity, himselfe being knowne to haue byn but a poore lad the other day in Rhemes, not a scholler of the Colledge for a good while, but seruant to M Boast now a holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, to make his bed and dresse vp his chÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and now as though he were another <hi>Licurgus</hi> he setteth downe the lawes of this new congregation with absolute authority beginning thus:</p>

Truly we heare say, that when the Cardinals Protectors heard and read these things in Rome, they could not choose but laugh, but yet they pittied our case also, considering therby the ambitious designmÄts of this new comon welth and commanded the Commissary to enquire of M.

I haue seene diuers letters, and heard by more reports of diuers differences eyther begonne or continued there among brethren, and such as ought to be frÄds; with more vehemency then I could haue wished, especially in such a tyme of persecution, as this is, many are scÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized with it, and our cause is defamed

                     <p>These and many other such letters were wrytten at that tyme, both by the R. Archpriest and his assistents, as also by F. Garnet, and others of the Society, and by many particular mÄ of the quieter sort, vnto their dearest frends about this affayre, wherby may be seene their true inward sÄse and meaning conserning the same, to wit,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:176260:164"/> that they most hartily and sincerly desired and procured it. The other side also made shew of the same desire or at least wayes to accept therof, but whether it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly &amp; sinceer, or outward only for a shew to satisfie the world for a tyme (for that they had protested euery where, that vpon the first sight of his Hol. Breue they would yeild) this God only can truly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and must iudge when tyme shalbe,<note place="margin">Double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse much doubted in some that made peace.</note> and the most likely is that diuers of them meant plainly &amp; sinceerly indeed, though of some of them, it is doubted that they made the peace only in external shew for the tyme, assuring themselues, that there would not want some probable occasion afterward to breake againe, and to lay the cause of breach vpon the other syde, as in effect we see it did ensue. For that a new deuise being shortly after cast out, that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction must be made to them for some former hard speches vsed or wrytÄ against them in tyme of the contention, and that otherwayes their good names should be taken from them, this was a sufficient match to put fyre againe to all that which had byn raked vp before by the endeauour of the forsaid peace.</p>
                     <p>Now then all the question standeth in this, which part hath broken the peace or
<pb facs="tcp:176260:165"/> which was most like to haue desire to maintaine and conserue the same.<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy discussed vvho did breake the peace made.</note> For dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing of which controuersy we might vse that argument of <hi>Cassius: Cui bono?</hi> who are like to receyue most good or hurt, by the peace kept or broken? For the Archp. and the clergy ioyned with him enioyed by the peace all that they could desire, to wit quiet establishment of their subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, honor, reputation, rest, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and his Hol. confirmation of all their doinges. The Iesuits also had asmuch as they could desire, and were satisfied in all points as appeareth by their owne letters aboue recited. But on the other side ensued the quite cÅtrari in all respects so as it could not be imagned, but that by this pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they receaued <hi>secundum hominem</hi> much greefe and inward indignation.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:166"/> it is very likely they agreed with him, that in no case what soeuer determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation should come from Rome, peace should be made or kept with the Archp. and Iesuites which poynt it may be M. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington and M. Mush did somwhat gesse at, when they shewed so much doubt to the Archp. (as before yow haue hard) of bringing D. Bagshaw into this recÅciliatiÅ. But how so euer this be we nothing doubt but that these three were egged on by the said doctor to make this appeale and open breach from the Archp. for that the like was practised by him and his of VVisbich before, and from what fountayne he might haue his influence in these affayres doth diuers wayes appeare.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:176260:166"/> first for the matters of VVisbich it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspected that Doct. Bagsh. was a great cause of the remoual of F. Edm. &amp;c. these suspitions are alleaged: First the day after D.B. was gone the minister of the Towne coming to the Castel, said, that D.B. tould him, that he looked to be remoued, or it were long and therfore it is thought that he was the cause of his owne remoue. Secondly, presently after D. B. depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he sent this message to M. Bluet, that the cause of his sending for was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning certaine matters which M. Bluet and he had oftymes talked of; and that he had not thought that those matters would haue ben brought to passe so soone as he saw they would; what matters these should be, but the remouing of Father Edmunds, &amp;c. we cannot coniecture. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by reason that M. D. B. sent to haue his portion of money as he had before, &amp; that it was denyed by many, and by M. Archer especially who said he could need no money that had 40.<note place="margin">This is he that vvas sent vp and dovvne to raise repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits Supra Cap. 6. &amp; 7.</note> crownes to geue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fisher, M. Bluet fel into a great rage, gaue him many oprobrious woords, and by multiplying of speches, he swore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, he would cal the Constable, which he did, but when he came in, he
<pb facs="tcp:176260:167"/> had little to say to him, but entertayned him curteously with a pot of ale. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he sent M. Archer this message, that if he did not come to submit himselfe vnto him before the next morning at ten of the clocke, before God he would wryte to the councel, for that he would not be hanged for neuer a knaue of them all. VVhether he did or no it is not certainly knowne; But this is certaine that M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, &amp;c, were remoued to the Towre not long after. Now after the remouing of F. Edm. the very Protestants themselues did say, that if in the castle they had not bin false amongst themselues F. Edm. &amp;c. had neuer byn sent for. Also both before their departure and after; some frends sent word that there was a false brother amongst them who had reueyled all the secrets of the house and byd them looke for troubles.</p>
                  <p>After the departure of F. Edm it went round that the troublesome fellowes at VVisbich were gone, and that the Iesuits sought to kil the Q. &amp; hÄg D.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:176260:167"/> should be so, the rest proposed three things to thÄ, which if they would graÅ«t, thÄ they should come with their good wil, other wise they would neuer consent vnto it.<note place="margin">The appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of some in VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Breue.</note> First to submit themselues to the Archp. to this they answered: They had appealed. The second was to liue vnder the same ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that the rest did, to this they answered they would not, for that they would haue no lawes but the lawes of the Church. They being asked who should explicate them, they answered, God would prouide &amp; sayd they doubted not but there would be meanes sufficient to curbe those that would not be quiet,<note place="margin">Tis is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be by vvay of the Councel vvith vvhome they dealt.</note> they were demaunded to tel, what that was, but they would not.

                        <p>This was the decree: And it is strange that any Cathol. priest would aduenture to breake it so openly and to glory in it by wryting when he hath done.

For wheras the Archpriest was the principal man to whome and towards whome he should performe these good offices it appeareth by the first letter that euer he wrote to him after his entrance into England to wit the 24. of May 1600.<note place="margin">A quarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling letter of M.Ch. to the Archp. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vpÅ his cÅming into Engl.</note> that he sought occasion to quarrel with him.

This is to request yow in charity to wryte to me, why sending for me to declare the Authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yow by Card.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:173"/> at that tyme said were annexed, &amp;c.</hi> And then he chargeth him with fowre particular points which the Archpriest denyeth that he euer said, that they were expressely in his instructions from <hi>Rome.</hi> And he that knoweth both the men, wil easily see, who of the twayne is most to be beleeued.</p>
                        <p>VVel after this followed stil worse and worse effects, stryfe, contention, contempt of Superiors iniurious letters wryttÄ both to the Archpriest and his frends. Appeales euery where from his authority aswel by them of VVisbich as other where abroad, which were heere ouerlong and tedious, yea lothsome to repeate. Yet may we iudge of mÄs spirits in this behalfe, when 8. priests togeather subscribed a letter to their said Superior with this sentence in it among other:<note place="margin">A contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious letter of D.B. &amp; his fellovves to the Archp. 19.

                        <p>And this they say to him, hauing in effect giuen him the <hi>Lye,</hi> diuers tymes in the said letter before, and for that he had said in his letter to them, <hi>that the greater part of VVisbich</hi> (which were triple to these men) <hi>semed to him both the bigger and better part,</hi> they accuse
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:176260:173"/> him heere of no lesse then of blasphemious behauiour in that he taketh vpon him the part of God to iudge in such matters, who is the better part.

<pb facs="tcp:176260:174"/> also how much they should pleasure and gratify the Counsel by this course.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:176260:176"/> nay further if the Archp. himselfe had not presented these appellations to his Holines perhaps he had not hard of them till this day, which is a token that iustice and trial is not sought by these men but gayning of tyme and liberty in England for the meane space from all Superiority.

All these and other like poynts, we meane to let passe in this place (though highly they greeue vs) and to handle other heads appertayning to fouler faults, if worse may be that is to falshood, deceyt, malice and slaunderous calumniations. For as it had byn a great synne to haue published in these bookes so many opprobrious and ignominious things against their brethren,<note place="margin">Deuised contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fault.</note> though they had byn true, not being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any excusable necessity thervnto,

            <p>This then is our purpose in this short vewe of these bookes, remitting the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in euery part for larger proofe of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to the chapters before handled.</p>
            <p>And to begin with the latyn booke which is dedicated to his Hol. whose title is this: <hi>Declaratio motuum, &amp;c. A d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">The title of the latyn booke and falshoods therin vsed.</note>
               <hi>that haue rysen in England, betweene the Iesuits on the one syde, togeather with M. George Blackewel Archpriest in all things fauoring them: and the Seminary priests on the other syde, from the death of Cardinal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len of pious memory, vnto this years,</hi> 1601.</p>
            <p>In this very title and first page, fiue or six abuses sleights &amp; shifts may be noted to be vsed towards his Hol. which may giue a gesse of the truth in the rest of their bookes especially that in English which they might presume would not be so much examyned. For first wheras the whole world knoweth, that their controuersy is with the Archpriest as appeareth by their appellation to his Hol. Anno 1600. 17. Nouemb. &amp; others before; &amp; that their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make against the Iesuits is for stÄding with
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:176260:178"/> him &amp; for him as by the whole discourse of both these bookes appeareth. Heere they change the whole cÅtrouersy, and do say that it is <hi>with the Iesuits and M. Blackwel that fauoreth them:</hi> so as he is put heere but as an <hi>Appendix</hi> in the cause which is playne falshood.</p>
            <p>Secondly they put the priests of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries residing in England for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite part against the said Archpriest and Iesuits, wheras it hath byn proued in the former Chapter that these cÅtentious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not the twentith part therof, by their owne confessions. Thirdly they say in this title that their contentions against the Iesuits began from the death of Card. AllÄ wheras we haue shewed before in the fourth chapter, by Card. Allens owne let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that some of these seditious, to his great dislike had begone to styrre against the Fathers in England euen in his dayes Fourthly they say: <hi>Ad S.D.N. Clementem octauum exhibita ab ipsis sacerdotibus:</hi> that this declaration was exhibited by the priests themselues to our most Holy F. <hi>Pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the 8. which how true or false it is, his Hol. wil best testifie, who vnto this day as we heare hath neither seene the booke nor hard of it, by any of them or theirs, nor is not like to do, noe more then he
<pb facs="tcp:176260:179"/> hath done hitherto of their appeales, for that their intention seemeth not to be to enforme his Hol. but to make a noise in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and to gaine tyme of liberty, and to preoccupate some mens mynds by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a shew that they appeale to the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghest, in this their controuersy, but yet in deed would be loth that he should know it, and much lother to answere it before him especially this Pope, whome they knowe by his former acts (what so euer they say) to be an enimy to their clamors and contentions and especially to libelling And if they had meant truly, and sincerly to exhibite this declaration to his Hol. and that by themselues, as heere they say, thÄ should they not haue needed to haue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it first, or at least wayes not without his licence or liking. But hauing published it both to heretikes and Cathol. &amp; vsed the help and counsel of heretikes especially in the matter and not sent it to Rome at all, it is very manifest what they meane, and a playne mockery to put in their title, that it was exhibited by themselues to his Hol.</p>
            <p>Fifthy vnder the title they put this verse of the psalme.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psalm. 106.</hi> The great abusing of a text of scripture.</note>
               <hi>Videbunt recti &amp; latabuntur, &amp; omnis iniquitas opilabit os suum.</hi> The good shal see this and be glad, and all iniquity shal stop her mouth at it. VVhich how true it
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:176260:179"/> is, and with what spirit it is applyed, to wit, that all good men wilbe glad and reioyse to see this contention amongst our selues (except by good men, they meane only hererikes) and how the mouth of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity shalbe stopped by this lamentable sedition in our owne bowels, let other men iudge, for we cannnt see it, but rather the quite contrary, to wit that all good men that haue any sense or feling of piety do mourne &amp; grone at this sight and very hearing hereof and that the mouth of all iniquity (if heresy &amp; atheisme be iniquity) is not shut, but opened by this occasion to laughe at vs and blaspheme our cause, <hi>vtinÄ iste non imputetur,</hi> we pray God he impute it not to these our brethren at the last day.</p>
            <p>Sixtly and lasty it is said in this first page that it was printed: <hi>Rhotomagi apud Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum molaeum subsignum Phaenicis:</hi> At Rhoane in France in the house of <hi>Iames Moleus</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the signe of the Phenix: And whether there be any such signe or man dweling in Roan we cannot yet precisely say, but haue sent to enquyre, yet in the meane space we are most certainly persuaded the thing in it selfe to be false, and that as rhe booke was printed without licence of any Superior (except perhaps the false Bishop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) and that it was printed in England it
<pb facs="tcp:176260:180"/> selfe sheeweth not only the playne En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish charecters therin contayned, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that themselfes in the end of the booke, for excusing the faults in printing say thus: <hi>Propter variaes horum temporum difficultates, &amp;c. VVe haue byn forced through the difficultyes of these tymes to vse the help of any printer, though vnexpart in the latyn toung, and therby to diuulge this present narration ful of many faultes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to thÄselues.</note>This they say in the end of the latyn booke, forgetting what they sayd in the beginning and first page that it was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Roan, where no difficulty of the tymes could hinder them nor learned prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters want seing there are comonly as good prints and printers in that cytie, as in most cittyes of Europe, soo as heere falshood doth discouer it selfe diuers wayes, vsed euen to his Hol. himselfe, and the truth seemeth to be that these bookes were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in England by consent of the heretikes, but yet in some secresy for auoyding the knowledg of the Catholikes more then of the enemy: Nay now it is further knowne how the matter of this printing hath past vnder the protection of my Lord of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to whome his Hol. is much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for suffering bookes dedicated to him to passe with so little let or hindrance.</p>
            <p>VVel then these six absurdityes, shifts,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:176260:180"/> &amp; falshoods beeing discouered in the very first page of the booke as preamble to the rest, and vsed euen to his Hol. himselfe, we may imagine what the remnant wilbe. And so at the very first entrance, they tel his Hol <hi>what a great scandal it is and wil be to the world to haue these dissensions in England come abroad,</hi> and yet they are content to publish them, geuing two reasons, such as they bee for the same.<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> First that they could not haue copyes inough in wrytten hand. The second to get their good name againe in forraine nations taken away as they say, by the Iesuits. But the first point of hauing many copyes was not needful if they were only for his Hol. information as they pretend. And the second in our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion wil fal out quite contrary, to wit that wheras they were not infamous before in forraine nations, nor knowne at all, now they must needs be, by these their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famatory wrytings.</p>
            <p>All that they tell after this of Cardinal Allen, from pag. 6.<note place="margin">About Card. AllÄ.</note> that he fauored them or misliked the Iesuits, or concurred with these factions and their emulations against them, is refuted largely before in the 3. and 4. Chap. of his treatese. And as for that by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting florish brought in pag. 8. against F.<note place="margin">About F. Heyvvood.</note> Gaspar Heywood, that he did vaunt and

Allen, F. Persons, M. Blackwel, and others did not allow, and F. Heywood yeelded vnto these mens opinions; and this is all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that euer was betwene F.

            <p>After this treatese of M. Champneyes,<note place="margin">A letter of F. Persons discussed.</note> they haue placed a letter of F. Persons wrytten the 9. of Octob. 1599. to M. Bishop in Paris, for answere of certaine greeuous calumniations which he and his fellow M. Charn. (and others vpon these mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) had spread abroad the world of the hard and iniurious dealing vsed to them in Rome, which reports being contrary to all truth, and their owne confessions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made at their departure, and not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching so much in deed F. Persons (though in words they would seeme to lay all vpon him) as the two Cardinals &amp; his Holines; with the commissary appoynted to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, and the whole iustice of the citty &amp; Sea Apostolike; it seemed necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to F. Persons to lay forth breefly the plaine truth of the fact, and so he doth. And albeit they haue set forth not only an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere thervnto made by M. Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but also a much more malitious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary or censure wrytten by M. I. B. yet is there not one iote of the said letter truly and substantially reproued, as by equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination wil appeare.</p>
            <p>And first for the Censurer I. B. to make himselfe matter to play, as though he were a cunning Cabalist in discussing of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, he deuideth the said letter into 24.
<pb facs="tcp:176260:192"/> paragraphes, and so leapeth from one to the other, forth and backe referring yow now to this and now to that, as yow may easily perceaue, his desyre is to dally &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the reader, and to seeme to say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, wheras he saith nothing in substÄce, but only vttereth his gaule of spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that man to whome (if we be not deceaued) he hath more obligation then to most men liuing. VVe wil shew an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or two, and so leaue the rest to a more particular examination of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tese which herafter may chaunce to be made, if this do not suffice.</p>
            <p>He maketh a great styrre and so doth M. Bishop also, and often repeateth the same, that F. Persons contradicteth himselfe at the very beginning in these words: <hi>M. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, it being now diuers monethes since yow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from hence, and no one letter appearing yet from yow, nor from your frend, M. Charn. it made vs maruayle considering your promise at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, &amp;c.</hi> And then in the second para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphe: <hi>By a stale letter which I receyued this weeke from yow, I perceyue, &amp;c.</hi> Heere they say is a great contradiction, affirming first no letter had appeared, and then confessing, that he receaued one this weeke.<note place="margin">Ansvvere to a cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> But we answere it breefly. F. Persons sayth that frÅ May to Nouember is more then halfe a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:176260:192"/> yeare; in which tyme no letter was come from them contrary to their promises, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this present weeke. VVhat great contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictiÅ is this, &amp; how desyrous are these mÄ of quarrels, that lay hands of such cauils.</p>
            <p>Another matter oftentymes brought in and tossed vp and downe by the censurer, is, that a propositiÅ of heresy was obiected against the Archpriest in Rome,<note place="margin">Cap. 9.</note> wherof yow haue heard before what it was, to wit, <hi>that no appellation could be made from him,</hi> and secondly how substantially it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, M. Bishop affirming in his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had it of his fellow Robert, &amp; his fellow saying no one word in all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination thereof though he were asked about the Archpriest by name, &amp; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest wholy denying it, and disclayming the same by a particuler letter to M. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noke himself at his fyrst commyng into Engl. in May 1600. Yet this censurer is not ashamed to bring it in oftentymes and to wryte thus of it;<note place="margin">pag. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>if it should be true which F. Persons sayth that M. Blackwel was touched in the very matter of his faith,</hi>

I doubt their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their going to Rome</hi> (to wit the two messengers) <hi>wil hardly be shaken.</hi> And againe in another place: <hi>An heretical proposition is sayd to haue byn deposed against M.

Blackwel withal, being a thing as we see neyther grounded in it selfe, nor prooued, nor affirmed, by any mÄ, but only cast out by hearesay, and tossed vp and downe to make a noyse as yow see. So as these men haue no scruple of conscience to seeke to defame their brethren, yea their Superiors; by what deuise soeuer.</p>
            <p>VVe do let passe the 21. reasons which this censurer layeth togeather by distinct numbers to discredit the Protectors letters, which his Holines afterward confirmed, and affirmed to haue byn wrytten by his knowledge order &amp; proper motion.<note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> VVe haue spoken of it before,<note place="margin">21.

            <p>There followeth lastly the answere of M. Bishop to the same epistle, contayning
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:176260:193"/> two parts,<note place="margin">M. Bish. ansvvere to F.

            <p>The second part treateth of their vsage in Rome, wherin diuers particulars are said by him with such passion as men that knew him before do wonder at him, seing the contrary may be prooued, by most au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical testimonyes and witnesses yet aliue; and part of his passion may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, by this interrogation or exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>VVhat an irreligious and damnable slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (sayth he) <hi>was that inuented of purpose to haue vs taken, and shut vp before we were heard? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this we aske him againe; is this so haynous or damnable or vnsual a matter to restraine a couple of priests where so many complaints had byn wrytten of their presumption &amp; contempt and of the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal raysed by their contention as we haue set downe before &amp; doth not euery prince this to greater mÄ then they they are,<note place="margin">Supra ca. 9.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them first, and after hearing their cause: &amp; further we would aske thÄ, were

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The true causes of their excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note>But the cause of all this is, for that these our discÅtented Brethren being yong men euil mortified and accustomed to all liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can abide no Superior at all, nor beare any act of Superiority vsed towards them, as this mÄ himself M. Bishop being demÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at Rome vnder his oth of the causes
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:176260:194"/> of stryfe in the Castle of VVisbich, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it was about certaine rules which the greater part would haue brought in, and the lesser part would not, wherof arose scandal, and when the Commissary replyed, he maruayled how any good man, could be scandalized with pious rules of good lyfe, this man answered: <hi>Sunt Sacerdotes saeculares, &amp; volunt viuerÃ¨ libere,</hi>

            <p>VVherfore wheras this man, and some of his fellowes do often vrge against F.P. in this place and other where of our late good Cardinal Allen his sweet and gentle gouernment and loue which therby he got and retayned: Truth it is,<note place="margin">About Card AllÄs manner of proceeding</note> that his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was such to giue what contentment he could to all men, both by letter and word, and a most honorable disposition no doubt it was, though he could not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by auoyd the euil tounges of all discÅtÄted, as the world knoweth and hath byn she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before by diuers letters and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes aswel of his owne as others.<note place="margin">Cap. 3. &amp; 4.</note> Neyther haue we seene ot hard of any letter of F.
<pb facs="tcp:176260:195"/> Persons, that hath gon in other style, then that which the Cardinal vsed. Neyther haue we spoken with any that could truly complayne of hard words in dealing with F. Persons. His actions also what they haue byn both in Spaine and Rome both to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifye, and pacify all are easily seene, but the difference is in the tyme, and our priests being greatly increased in number, and growen also in stomacke, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal being dead, whose authority they respected, and no other succeeding him in his place, that could punish by office or authority, yong men haue come; partly by multitude &amp; liberty; partly by inductiÅ of other vnquiet spirits to be impatiÄt of rule, &amp; restraynt. And the selfe same motiue that induced his Hol. to giue thÄ a Superior, to wit lacke of order in so growing a body (which yet was not so needful while the Cardinal liued) inuited them to repyne at the same. And if the good Cardinal had liued to this day to haue consented as he would haue byn enforced to such a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in England for their restraynt, that would not be restrayned, he had had (no doubt) his part of contradiction, as the good father hath had, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with so open mouth, as against the father, for that they would haue feared

            <p>VVherfore to make an end, seeing these matters are like to be handled afterwards, againe as we heare, more largly to his Hol. &amp; particular matters better examined, we say that the bitternes &amp; inmodesty of these treateses against so worthymÄ of our owne religion do wonderfully cÅdemne the spirit of the wryters, but nothing more then the exceding rancor vsed against this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, which so many wayes hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited both vs and ours. And to the end that the Reader may see how euidÄtly this proceedeth of the common ennemy, we shal make a particular chapter of the egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious iniuryes done vnto him by manifest slaunders &amp; calumniations which no doubt do proceed in great parte either by compact with the persecutors or els with intention to gratifye them therby.</p>

            <p>In the 23. pag. of the latyn booke, where they begin to inueigh against F. Persons in particular they say thus: <hi>Quid intereÃ  P. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Personius, alias Cubbuccus,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:176260:199"/> with him &amp; were priuy to his doings heerin, as also of other lay gentlemen that know the same. For better explication wherof, &amp; of diuers other iniurious slÄders that are to follow, we shal be forced to repeat breefly some poynts about F. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons intÄtions and doings wherof we haue informed our selues, and might be omyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if these calumniations did not driue vs to vtter them.</p>
            <p>F. Persons being master of art and fellow of Balioal Colledge in Oxford, left the same about the yeare 1573. as we take it, and the next yeare after went ouer the Sea to trauaile and study in Padua, &amp; the next yeare after that againe, which was the yeare of Iubiley, he went to Rome and entred the <hi>Society of Iesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">F.P. first coming to Rome and entring the Society &amp; his first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Rome.</note> and 4. or 5. yeares after that againe to wit in the yeare 1579. a new Seminary in Rome being begon &amp; instituted, and aboue 30. English youthes dismissed thence vpon a certaine falling out betwene M. Doctor Ouen Lewes then Archdeacon of Cambray and after Bishop of <hi>Cassane,</hi> and them, the said Father procured their stay by the help of Father Toledo afterward Cardinal, who at that tyme was preacher to Pope Gregory the 13. and greatly in his fauor, and so an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made with Doctor Lewes againe.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:176260:199"/> And for better cÅfirmatiÅ of the Seminary vocatiÅ he procured that the first forme of oath now vsed, was brought into the RomÄ Seminary, &amp; after that exÄple by himselfe into the Seminaries of Spaine afterwards, wherby all promised to take holy orders &amp; returne to England when they should be appoynted by their Superiors, wherby we may see from the very begining and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since, what a furtherer he hath byn to priestly vocation and function, wherunto now these our brethren would make men beleeue that he were an enemy.</p>
            <p>And these breaches in Rome being wel accomodated by his sollicitation, the next poynt he procured, was to haue M. Doct. Allen called to Rome (as he was) to the end there might be a good correspondence set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led betweene the two Seminaries of Rome and Rhemes: and then himselfe in the yeare ensuing to wit 1580. being sent by Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the 13. togeather with F. Campian into England, at the sute of Doct. Allen in name of all English Catholikes who desired greatly the assistence of the Iesuits in that mission, F. Persons was appointed by his General to be Superior therof. And this was the first mission that euer the Society had into England.</p>
            <p>His actions in England were (as before
<pb facs="tcp:176260:200"/> hath byn 'declared) for the space of some yeare and halfe, or there about. to wit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the yeare 1581. at what tyme F. CÄpian being taken and impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and F. Heywood and F. Holt being come in, to take their places, and the print and printers which F. Persons had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for diuulging of Cath. bookes being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and intercepted, &amp; himselfe being at that tyme in Sussex and hauing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of passage into Fraunce offered him, he had a great consultation with himselfe, and other graue Priests that were with him, whether he should go ouer or no, for better disposing of a certaine vrgent busynes in hand, which he could not wel do without his presence beyond the Sea, but yet with intention to returne as soone as might be. His cheefest busynes as we vnderstÄd were these that do ensue.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First he had diuers Catholike bookes &amp; treateses partly already wrytten, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begone in defence of Catholike religion, which could not now be printed in EnglÄd his presse and printers, and M.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly he had many points of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be cÅferred by mouth with Doct. Allen, as namely to hasten the editiÅ of the english new testament, for the which he had procuted him 300. pound of assistÄce from certaine Catholikes his spiritual chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in England, the maner also of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning and holding vp the English missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as wel of Secular priests, as of the Society, for which the said Father had obserued diuers things of weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly diuers Catbolikes in England perceyuing the difficultyes of the tyme to grow on, and that they could not haue Cath. scholemasters in rheir houses at home as they weare wont had treated with the father to prouide them some succour or place of education beyond the Seas for their yonger children that were not yet fit for their yeares and learning to be of the Seminaries of Rhemes or Rome, which he could nor hope to do but by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly her maiestie of Scotland being then in prison in England, as she had procured, first that the said Father had sent a priest into Scotland named M. VVats, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:176260:201"/> after F. Holt, one of the Society to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the seed of Cath. Religion in that countrey to the good of her sonne the yong king, if it might be, especially now after the putting downe of the Earle Morton an heretical gouernor, &amp; of the aduauncement of the duke of Lenox to that roome being Catholikely inclyned, so had she procured also, that the said father had wrytten to Rome to haue some fathers of the Scotish nation in like maner to be ioyned in this mission, whervpon two beeing appoynted to wit F. Edmund Hayus, and F. VVilliam Cryton, it was thought very necessary, that F. Persons should passe ouer to Roan to conferre with them of their said missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before they tooke it in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly F. Persons had vpon his hands at that tyme two yong gentlemen M. George Gilbert and M. Charles Basset, whome he loued dearly, and who for the Cath. cause were forced to fly the land as persecuted and sought for by name, whome the said faiher could not wel leaue vntil he had seene them safely accommodated beyond the Seas which he did by his presence there.</p>
            <p>These then and some other reasons we haue vnderstood partly by the father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, &amp; partly by those with whome he cÅsul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:176260:201"/> before he went ouer,<note place="margin">Vtilityes that in sued by. F P. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into Franco.</note> were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal arguments of that his iorney. All which points had good and profitable effects by his going ouer. For touching the first poynt, he set forth diuers good bookes in <hi>Roane,</hi> as the <hi>Epistle of persecutiÅ,</hi> both in latyn and English, the <hi>defence of the Censure against Charke, The booke of resolution,</hi> &amp; some others concerning deuotion. Touching the 2. poynt he helped much the speedy edition of the English Testament, with the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of future missions. Touching the 3. he obtayned a new Seminary for English youths at Ewe in NormÄdy with 100 pound pensiÅ a yeare of the Duke of Guise,<note place="margin">Seminary of Evve.</note> besides a house lent gratis by the Fathers of the Society, who also read vnto them, with diuers other helpes of diuers other French Catholikes, all which the said Father procured and established at his being there, and placed a gouernour ouer them of our owne nation, a graue ancient man named M. Chambers, which indured vntil the yeare 1588. when the said good Duke fel himselfe,<note place="margin">Seminary of S. Omers</note> and then the said Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soone after procured the erection of another Seminary in S. Omers farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; to the same effect.</p>
            <p>The fourth and fifth poynts, what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse they had euery man knoweth, for that
<pb facs="tcp:176260:202"/> out of this first mission to Scotland procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the said Father hath ensued the good number of Catholikes which synce that tyme Gods holy grace hath brought forth in that realme by his seruÄts labours. And as for the two foresaid gÄtlemen Gyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert and Basset after great example and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of vertue much edification giuen, &amp; many good workes performed, they died most holily, the one in Rome, the other in Rhemes, hauing distributed first aboue 10000. crownes in almes, partly to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of Rhemes, &amp; partly to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Syon</hi> and other religious persons, &amp; pious vses.</p>
            <p>Now then all this being so, let euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man iudge, how vnworthy a slaunder it is for these our brethren, or him that wrote this booke to cal Father Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>ignauum militem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 24. An vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorthy in solency.</note>
               <hi>&amp; desertorem castrorum Dei.</hi> A dastardly souldier and forsaker of the campes of God, wheras most of these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators were yong schollers at that tyme, and some of them no schollers at all, nor euer perhaps had byn, if F.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:176260:202"/> by his iorney to the King of Spaine, by going also to Rome with Doctor Allen, &amp; procuring his aduauncement, for better strengthening of the whole cause, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly by his going into Spayne with great daunger of his lyfe, and procuring not only the yearly continuance of that kings assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the Seminaries of Rhemes, and after at Doway againe in those most hard tymes of the warres of France, but the erection also of diuers other new Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and residences for the English nation, as that of <hi>Valiadolid, Syuil,</hi>

            <p>All which we are forced heere to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member brefly for answering these sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or rather shamelesse calumniations of these our vngrateful brethren, who hauing neuer done any one iote in this kynde, but rather fed and byn nourished for the most part of them, vpon this mans labors &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, now obiect that against him, to wit, <hi>his going forth of England</hi> without which it is like they had not byn now priests nether without nor within England, for that if matters were wel examined, yow should fynd that many of them were sent in by him, and many more susteyned beyÅd Seas by his endeauors.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:176260:203"/>
            <p>And as for forsaking the camps of God, we see by experience of temporal warre, how iniurious a slaunder it is against this man: For that he who retyreth only from the station of a particular souldier to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the whole tents, and to furnish from thence more souldiers, and other necessary prouision for the maintenÄce and strÄgthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the whole, cannot be said to haue forsaken the camp, but to assist it more then the rest. And thus much for this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation. The rest we shal passe ouer more breifly.</p>
            <p>The third accusation against F. Persons, is, that after his going out of England, <hi>nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam exinde destitit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. pa. 24 The 3. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst F. P.</note>
               <hi>aut libellis contra Primarios Reipub. magistratus aut litteris factiosis irritare temporalem regni statum.</hi>
               <q>That he neuer ceased to exasperate the cheefe magistrats of the common wealth with wryting libels, and the temporal state of the whole kingdome by factious letters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This calumniation is refuted cleerly by that we haue said in the precedent chapter in answere to the third demaund of M. Mush about prohibition of exasperating bookes where it is shewed,<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> that albeit he with the same splene and vntruth (as this man doth heere if he be not the same) doth name only F. Persons, yet he is the man
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:176260:203"/> amongst al other Catholike English wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for whose bookes men haue least byn called in trouble, so farre as we knowe. And we thinke our angry brethren cannot giue any one instance to the contrary, wheras for diuers books of Doctor Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Doctor Bristow, and Card. Allen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers searches, troubles, and examinatiÅs are knowne to haue byn made, &amp; yet are they not so much as mentioned by these men, wherby is euident their passion, and that they seeke only cauillations against Father Persons.</p>
            <p>And wheras this fellow heere calleth them libels we haue told in part, what they are, and others may not so wel be named, and yet Catholikes know them, or can gesse at them. And one only booke amÅg them, to wit, that of the <hi>Christian directory or Resolution,</hi> is knowne to haue gayned more soules to God, then all these men ioyned togeather can euer hope to do, especially with this spirit which now they shew. And wheras these men heere do note in the margent these woords, when they talke of exasperating books, <hi>Patris Personij liber de successione.</hi> They do shew maruelous rancor, and corrupt affection,<note place="margin">About the booke of Succession</note> and no iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or desyre of truth at all. First for that it was neuer hard of in England, that any
<pb facs="tcp:176260:204"/> special persecution was made for this booke. Secondly they do not know but by their owne presumptiÅ, that this book is more to be attributed to F. Persons, then to the late Cardinal Allen, Sir Frauncis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glefeld, and other principal men of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are knowne to haue concurred to the laying togeather of that book, as by their owne hands is yet extant, and this to the publike benefit of our Cathol. cause: First that English Catholikes might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what special and precise obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they haue to respect religion in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any new prince aboue all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects humayne vnder heauen, and this is handled largely, clearly, &amp; with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of learning, reasons, doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples throughout the first booke. And in the second booke is shewed to the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the great diuersytie of pretenders that are or may be after her Maiestie that now is, to the Crowne, euery man and woman in their rancke and degree, allowing to euery one the vttermost reasons that may be for them offering iniury to none, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of any, but leauing all in suspÄce to this only end, that catholikes seing their obligation; and beholding also their variety of choise in some cases might resolue of that, when tyme cometh which shalbe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:176260:204"/> most conforme to Gods glory, publike weale, &amp; their owne foresaid obligatiÅ for their soules. And this being the but of both these books, let wise men consider the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of these people, that make so much ado about it.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:176260:205"/> F. P. his imprudence and audacity abroad</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are greuous accusations if they were true, and being false are the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious reproches. Touching F. Persons therfore, it hath byn shewed and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he hath done nothing abroad to the preiudice of them at home, but rather much to their good. And as for these men, how much they are vrged or pressed by the temporal magistrate, the effects do shew, seing they are knowne to haue special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto them; &amp; fauor with them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, not only for their owne ease (those of them that be in prisoo) and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for them that liue abroad, but for the afflicting also of their Cathol. brethren in durance, that do not allow their seditious course; so as this accusation of their suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for F. Persons doings and wrytings is both euidently false in it selfe and very calumnious in the cause therof.</p>
            <p>The sixt accusation in this place is,<note place="margin">The 6. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniatiÅ against F. P. Pag. 24.</note> that F.

But for answere of this we remit the

            <p>F.

And among others one <hi>Christopher Bagshaw</hi> Bacheler of art at that tyme, and a litle before by F.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:176260:211"/> by carrying the said youth forth by night being of very tender age, to certayne commedies which F.

Bagshaw which act being expulsion by statute to deny any scholler, to the deane, especially his owne (for F. P. as we vnderstand was deane this yeare, of the house) and he hauing no other remedy (for he perceaued M. Squire to concurre secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly in this deuise) he called a publike Chap. of all the fellowes laying open the iniury done vnto him. But M. Squire with the Protestant fellowes being farre the greater part began presently (omitting this matter proposed) to picke quarrels of religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst F. Persons saying that he peruerted a great part of the youthes of the house,
<pb facs="tcp:176260:212"/> and that it was not meet that a man of his backwardnes in religion, should haue so many schollers and pupils of that quality which his weare, and finally they exhot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that seing already he had treated to go beyond sea he would presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe his fellowship, and they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him such reasonable tyme for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiÅ as he should thinke good in which tyme he should haue all the priuileges of his fellowship and offices which now he enioyed. And further they would sweare vnto him (as there they did) to keep his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation secret, and if he would not do this, they all protested, that they would violently ioyne togeather to haue him out with all his schollers,<note place="margin">A great vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lence and iniustice offred to F.

            <p>This being proposed and stood vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, and their turbulent dispositions being wel knowne the Catholike fellowes which thÄ were in the Colledge namely M. VVilson, M. Turner now Doct and some others persuaded F. Persons, that seing he had made his resolution to trauayle, and that they offered him three moneths space
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:176260:212"/> to perpare himselfe, and to sweare secresy in the meane space, and that if they should furiously make this assault vpon him and his schollers, as they were determined, he should hardly get remedy at the vysitors hand, who was then Doct. Cooper B. of Lincolne, for these and like respects (and for that God as we persuade our selues did worke also secretly therin, by these euil mens meanes, to get that man out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glÄd) he resolued with himselfe to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his fellowship, and so resigned the same, as before is said and they taking their oath of secresi, the matter was ended, &amp; all made great frends, as to outward shew appeared.</p>
            <p>But in the lent following F.

            <p>As for the other calumniation which followeth of the euil fame (as these men do speake) of F.

            <p>And albeit he deferred all this while to punish them for feare of some worse reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in themâª yet detested he their actions in this meane space.

            <p>This course then being wel pondered, togeather with that which hath byn spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before in the 2.<note place="margin">An impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</note> Chapter about this affayre of disobedience, to wit how daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a point it is, it semeth to vs that euery tender conscience that hath part in this matter, may haue iust cause to doubt how he standeth and whether he goeth.

            <p>It is a soare sentence of the Apostle concerning some that runne of wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; <hi>Tradidit illos Deus in reprobum sensum.</hi> God hath deliuered them ouer to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate sense, not to consider what they do.

               <hi>&amp; non dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet iustitiam: in terra sanctorum iniqua gessit, &amp; non videbit gloriam Domini:</hi> Let vs haue mercy vpon the wicked (saith God by the way of irrision) and he shal not learne the

            <p>But fearing of late or rather most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly assuring themselues, that their disorderly appeal to <hi>Rome</hi> made not only for themselues, but for all them in likc

            <p>And finally his last and greatest exployt (wherof he braggeth in his letter of the first of Iuly to M.

            <p>Now let any man iudge by this letter (which came to our hÄds as we were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Apology) how this matter goeth. Heere do enter (as yow see) all the peruerse and sinister meanes that can be deuised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst good Catholikes, by them that would seeme also to be no euil Catholikes, to wit, bribes, teares, treachery, false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:176260:227"/> calÅ«niatiÅs, exasperatiÅs, &amp; subtile conuentions in fauour of heretiks against our owne brethren. M Bluet saith, he had spÄt 12. poÅ«d in 14. weekes, which is almost 20. shilings a weeke, which needed not in a poore prisoner but that perhaps he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to giue bribes to haue his matter more set forward though if the B. of LondÅ haue byn so liberal vnto him as men report, he shal little need to complaine as he doth of the want of the poore diuident of VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bich almes. Secondly he saith that he hath both swet and wept: swet in going vp and downe, wept in beseeching the Counsel to be of their faction, which he needed not in our opinions,<note place="margin">M. Bluets teares to the Q. and counsel,</note> they being no lesse desirous to set it forward then he, and beter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had his teares byn spent to God for his owne synnes.</p>
            <p>He saith he hath laid the fault of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in England, &amp; of her Maiesties offence, where it ought to be, that is to say vpon the Iesuits, excusing most of the secular priests. But if her offence be specially for the defence made of Cath. religion and the increase therof procured by them, then is this accusation of M. Bluets more honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Iesuits then he would haue it; &amp; all good secular priests wil geue him litle thÄks
<pb facs="tcp:176260:228"/> for excusing them therin to her maiestie &amp; the councel as not offending in this behalfe But if he meane any other causes of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as practising against the state or the like, then is it calumnious to them both, First to all the Iesuits in England, who are no lesse innocent, vpon our consciences in this poynt then other priests, and secondly to the order of secular priests themselues, especially the better sort, adhering to their Superior, who are as innocent also in this behalfe as this mans (most part) which he would haue to be vnderstood perhaps those few of his side, &amp; so leaue al the other no lesse culpable and obnoxious to this slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as are the Iesuits, wheras it is knowne notwithstÄding that whiles all other both priests and Iesuits haue bin quiet and silent in state matters, these men haue bin busy as farre as their power or credit wil reach or as any prince would harken to them or deale with them. And this apeareth for that they haue sent of thier owne mÄ euen vnto Scotland to deale with that prince in matters of succession,<note place="margin">M. VVat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vvas sent and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> and haue tampered also with the K. of FrÄce by others of thier consorts to like effect, as the Lords them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of her Maiesties Councel cannot but know and at their going ouer into France
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:176260:228"/> we doubt not (and so we heare it already by some of their Counsel) but they meane to offer themselues wholy to that kings disposition for the next succession of our crowne, therby to gaine his grace and fauour, and yet they vaunt euery were that they and theirs are innocent in these affayres, and only Iesuits and their frends do deale therin. And so M. Bluet told the Q. and Counsel, <hi>and layd the fault where it ought to be.</hi>

            <p>VVherfore to draw to an end,<note place="margin">The 7. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration about the necessity &amp; facility of reunion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> and not to enlarge our selues further in this matter, we shal for conclusion put two considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in one, to wit the necessity and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this reunion and concord, which we desire should be made among vs.</p>
            <p>And for the first which is the necessity therof, besides all that which is said and signified before, so much more may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, as this poynt only might serue for a whole volume. For what matter did our Sauiour inculcate euet so much vpon earth to his followers as this point of vnion and mutual loue: <hi>In hoc sciant omnes, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 16.</note>
               <hi>By this note shal all men knowe, that yow are my disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if yow loue togeather, and haue peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong yow.</hi> VVhat did he so much pray for to his father, as for this grace of vnion among his seruants: <hi>vt omnes vnum sint,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 17.</note>
               <hi>sicut tu pater in me, &amp; ego in te.</hi> That all may be one, as thou my father art in me, and I in thee. Behold what a vnion he requireth?
<pb facs="tcp:176260:237"/> And then againe in the same prayer, <hi>vt ipsi in nobis vnum sint.</hi> That my disciples be one (o Father) in vs. And yet further: <hi>vt sint vnum, sicut &amp; nos vnum sumus:</hi> that they be one as we are one. And finally: <hi>vt sint cosummati in vnum:</hi> That they may be perfectly one.</p>
            <p>This was his exhortation and this was his prayer. But what were his threats to them that broke this vnion? Truly they were most dreadful in all his speaches, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as wel by his owne woords in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels, as by the wrytings of all his Apostles and disciples. S. Iohns epistle may serue for all,<note place="margin">Ioan, epist. 1.2.3.4.</note> who being priuy aboue the rest perhaps to the spirit of his Master, denounced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the necessity of this precept of loue and mutual vnion, and reprobation and damnation to those that breake or liue out of the same. VVherfore of this we shal need to say no more, seing all the old holy Fathers ioyntly do exaggerate this synne of making diuision and dissention, aboue all other synnes whatsoeuer; as a thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the spirit of the diuel and most opposite and contradictory, to the spirit of Christ.</p>
            <p>As for the second point, touching the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of making concord and reunion againe, if men wil leaue of acerbity of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:176260:237"/> &amp; put on the true affectiÅs of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mynd,<note place="margin">The facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king peace if men vvilbe Christian lyke myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> we see no great impedimÄts of difficulties therin. For we would aske our discontented brethren, that shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so mightely inraged, what is there which they would haue in this matter? who vexeth or vrgeth them? so as they may not liue quietly if they would? As for the Archpriest when the authority was layd vpon him which he in our cÅsciences little thought of;<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of cÅ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> &amp; much lesse desired (for what may be desireable in such an office at this tyme) no man can doubte but that if these men would haue bin quiet, &amp; not haue cÅ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted openly his authority, what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they had done secretly in Rome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise about it, yet would he neuer haue dealt thearin or vsed cÄsure against thÄ for it. And when he was forced to vse cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, yet we see, that he recalled all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, as soone as they began in any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shewe to accomodate themselues; &amp; now no doubt if they would do the same after so many and manifest declarations of his Hol. wil for the continuation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his authority, if they would giue ouer this impugnation and liue quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to themselues, there can be no doubt but that he for his part would be very glad
<pb facs="tcp:176260:238"/> therof, and embrace them all as his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and children without any further memory of former amaritude.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Iesuits ready to peace.</note>The Fathers also of the Society which haue stood with the Archpriest and the rest of the body of the Cleargie of England in defence of his Hol. ordination, if by this they haue giuen greefe vnto our brethren, the recompence is soone made, and therby also the reconciliation. They are men (as we wel knowe) thar desyre greatly to liue quietly &amp; priuately to themselues, as their vocatiÅ requireth, nor meane they to haue any thing at all to do with our brethren or their affayres, but in the way of loue and charity to do them good. They demaund no authority ouer them, nor euer had or sought iurisdiction vpon any one of them or others. They intend not to preiudice them in any preferment for the tyme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or to come. They pray for them, and desyre to embrace them whensoeuer occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shalbe offered, &amp; are content to put vp all iniuryes receyued by these libels both in their owne persons, and their whole Society, remytting the remedy to God and to their superiors. And this being their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (as most syncerely they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed vnto vs) what impediment can there
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:176260:238"/> be of reunion, if our brethren wil; and if they wil not, what excuse can they make eyther before God or man of this wilful breach and continuation therof?</p>
            <p>VVe and our brethren may liue in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land these twenty yeares,<note place="margin">All men may liue quietly if they vvil.</note> each man in his residence, quietly and contentedly, if we wil, without that eather Archpriest or Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite medle with vs, but only to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: and this wil of ours which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is nothing els, but orderly bearing our selues as honest, ciuil, and vertuous priests ought to do. If this may not be had, then must troubles and tumults continue stil with the effects before rehearsed, and God and his ministers must remedy them; from which obstinacy his deuyne Maiestie deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs all. And euery true Catholike, and especially priests in cÅscience are bound to with-draw themselues in tyme, saying with holy Iacob:<note place="margin">Genes 49.</note>
               <hi>in consilium corum non veniat anima mea.</hi> Let not my soule be partaker of this their counsel and obstinate resolution. And this is the but te whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this chapter, yea the whole book, hath byn directed.</p>
